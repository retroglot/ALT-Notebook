# Popular Music Is Plural

> RICHARD A. PETERSON

In the fall of 1971, when the debut issue of *Popular Music and Society* appeared with a Las Vegas-conquering Elvis pictured on its cover, it seemed to many that rock music had swept before it all other forms of popular music. Indeed, in his inaugural editorial introduction, Ron Denisoff first uses the term "popular music," but by the second paragraph has switched to the term "rock." Perhaps uneasy about the apparent emphasis on rock, Ron starts the final paragraph: "As a closing point, it should be made explicit, Popular Music and Society is not exclusively a rock journal. Papers on swing, jazz, country and western, folk, polka, and other genres will not only be most welcome but eagerly sought" ("Introduction"[^5]).

The image of rock-sweeping-all-before-it is echoed as well in a number of the chapters in the 1972 anthology The Sounds of Social Change, which Denisoff and I edited. This view was in line with the then-prevalent Frankfurt School-based ideas of Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, and others about the massification of popular culture in industrial society. According to that view, industrial mass production, saturation advertising, and the mass media had created an undifferentiated mass audience, which, like a herd of sheep, listlessly consumed a quick succession of mass culture products (Jay 173-218). In the process of massification, all the diverse pre-existing folk and regional popular forms were—according to the massification theorists—being obliterated or co-opted into the increasingly homogeneous mass culture represented, for example, by 1940s Tin Pan Alley pop music and Hollywood movies. The image of the mass person was nicely caught in the title of Herbert Marcuse's widely read 1964 book, One-Dimensional Man. But as Wilensky, Gans, and Swingewood, among others, had noted, the massification theorists provided only anecdotal evidence for the specter they had conjured.

Indeed a number of researchers who had grown up in the United States in the 1950s, including Denisoff and myself, found little empirical evidence for "massification" and purposefully used the term "popular" rather than "mass" culture to stress the voluntaristic nature of popular culture choices.[^1] Insofar as there were "outside forces" shaping popular music, Denisoff and I both showed that they were to be found not in some abstract force of massification but in clearly identifiable elements of the structure and operation of the music industry itself.[^2] And rather than show some linear trend toward massification, the workings of the culture industry in interaction with audiences and the larger society seemed to show dialectical cycles in symbol production.[^3]

At about the same time a number of young researchers working in England reported their observations among diverse youth groups including Mods, Teds, Rockers, Skinheads, Rastas, and Rudies (see Hall and Jefferson). Again contrary to the received theories of massification, they showed how these diverse groups of young people appropriated and adapted elements of mass-produced popular culture to fashion clearly distinct group identities marking themselves off from each other as well as from conformist middle-class youth. Grounded in this work, Dick Hebidge and Simon Frith showed the central place of popular music in the formation and expression of these politically resistant subcultures.

Two conclusions that fly in the face of the prediction of massification can be drawn from all this research of two decades ago. First, the mass production of popular music does not necessarily make for an increasingly homogeneous popular music. Clearly the homogeneity or diversity of popular music is historically variable, Second, the mass production of music does not make for the mass consumption of music. While there are fads, and trends, and manias, people transform popular music as they appropriate it and make it their own.

A great deal of more recent work shows the durability of the first conclusion. For example, Ennis argues that rock did not overtake and supplant pop music but formed a "seventh stream" among the other forms of commercial music. Lopes has persuasively shown that the multinational record forms that achieved oligopolistic control of the popular music industry in the mid-1980s have nonetheless marketed a diverse range of musical styles signaling a complete restructuring of the industry since the 1960s (Peterson and Berger, "Measuring"). Also, Goodwin, and Ryan and Peterson, have shown the potentially democratizing influences of the computer-based music-making technologies.

As for the second conclusion concerning consumption, a large number of more recent studies could be cited showing the selectivity and patterning of reception. For example, Hakanen and Wells, surveying the students in one large high school, have shown the diversity of musical taste cultures among this relatively homogeneous aggregation of adolescents. Peterson and Kern have shown something of the range of difference kinds of country music fans, and Bethany Bryson has shown that people use the expressed dislikes for specific kinds of music, as much as they do shared musical preferences, in defining group boundaries. Blau ("Elite" and "High") has contrasted the enduring plurality of popular musics across this country with the singular definition of what comprises classical music and the fine arts generally in all parts of the United States. Given the regional differences in popular culture, she somewhat facetiously concludes that the fine arts constitute our only shared national "mass culture." Peterson ("Understanding") likewise shows the consensually agreed-upon high status of classical music as compared with a diverse range of popular musics at the middle and lower end of the status hierarchy.

Clearly, therefore, popular culture is plural. And it seems destined to remain so for the foreseeable future, given the minutely differentiated segmentation of the contemporary commercial music emarket, given the great number of CD reissues of every kind of music in the 20th century, and given the proliferation of modes of distribution from cable television to the Internet.

Recognizing that popular music remains plural, there is still a world of things we, as researchers, don't know about this plurality. There are, for example, enduring differences in the ways that music is made for the rap, rock, reggae, and country music markets,[^4] but we still know very little about the structure and sources of these differences.

If anything, our understanding of how music is selected, enjoyed, and understood by people is even less clear. What *is* clear is that the standard categories such as rock and country are virtually meaningless. Take for example, three "county" artists: Hank Williams, Jr., Vince Gill, and k. d. lang. Persons who choose any one of these are very unlikely to like the other two. Those who choose Hank Williams, Jr., are likely to also like Steve Earle and Nine Inch Nails; those who choose Vince Gill are likely to add Mary Chapin Carpenter and the likes of Aaron Neville as well as romantic pop singers; those who choose k. d. lang are likely to select other feminist and lesbian artists who have never flirted with country music.

Even if the plurality is considered postmodernist bricolage, the question still remains, which bricks are selected together by some groups of people and which are rejected only to be picked up and formed into other meaningful structures? Thus, as I see it, the exciting research challenge now is to learn how this vast plurality of popular music is sorted and recombined by artists, by the people in the industry, and by diverse elements of the consuming public and to find what people's popular music choices mean to them.

[^1]: The early works of mine that were motivated by an interest in massification, and found good evidence to refute it, include Peterson ("Process"), Peterson and Berger ("Cycles"), and Peterson and DiMaggio.  

[^2]: See Denisoff (Solid and Tarnished), Peterson and Berger ("Cycles" and "Entrepreneurship"), and Peterson ("Why"). The influence of the industry in shaping popular music is also focal in the books of that era by Charlie Gillett, and Steve Chapple and Reebee Garofalo.  

[^3]: See especially Peterson and Berger ("Cycles") and Peterson ("Process," "Production," and "Dialectic").  

[^4]: This point is clear from conversations with Keith Negus, who is studying how the major record companies "run" the divisions making each of these kinds of music.
