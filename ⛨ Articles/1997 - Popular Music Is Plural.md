In the fall of 1971, when the debut issue of *Popular Music and Society* appeared with a Las Vegas-conquering Elvis pictured on its cover, it seemed to many that rock music had swept before it all other forms of popular music. Indeed, in his inaugural editorial introduction, Ron Denisoff first uses the term "popular music," but by the second paragraph has switched to the term "rock." Perhaps uneasy about the apparent emphasis on rock, Ron starts the final paragraph: "As a closing point, it should be made explicit, Popular Music and Society is not exclusively a rock journal. Papers on swing, jazz, country and western, folk, polka, and other genres will not only be most welcome but eagerly sought" ("Introduction"[^5]).

> 1971 年秋，当《流行音乐与社会》创刊号面世时，封面上印有征服拉斯维加斯的猫王照片，许多人觉得摇滚乐已经横扫了所有其他形式的流行音乐。事实上，在其创刊社论引言中，罗恩·德尼索夫首先使用了“流行音乐”一词，但到了第二段就改用了“摇滚”一词。也许对这种明显的摇滚乐偏重感到不安，罗恩在最后一段写道：“最后，需要明确指出，《流行音乐与社会》并非仅限于摇滚乐的期刊。关于摇摆乐、爵士乐、乡村音乐、西部音乐、民谣、波尔卡以及其他流派的论文不仅会受到热烈欢迎，而且会积极寻求”（“引言”[^5]）。

The image of rock-sweeping-all-before-it is echoed as well in a number of the chapters in the 1972 anthology *The Sounds of Social Change*, which Denisoff and I edited. This view was in line with the then-prevalent Frankfurt School-based ideas of Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, and others about the massification of popular culture in industrial society. According to that view, industrial mass production, saturation advertising, and the mass media had created an undifferentiated mass audience, which, like a herd of sheep, listlessly consumed a quick succession of mass culture products (Jay 173-218). In the process of massification, all the diverse pre-existing folk and regional popular forms were—according to the massification theorists—being obliterated or co-opted into the increasingly homogeneous mass culture represented, for example, by 1940s Tin Pan Alley pop music and Hollywood movies. The image of the mass person was nicely caught in the title of Herbert Marcuse's widely read 1964 book, One-Dimensional Man. But as Wilensky, Gans, and Swingewood, among others, had noted, the massification theorists provided only anecdotal evidence for the specter they had conjured.

> 摇滚乐横扫一切的意象在 1972 年由 Denisoff 与我共同编辑的文集《The Sounds of Social Change》的多个章节中亦得到呼应。这一观点与当时盛行的基于法兰克福学派的思潮一脉相承，诸如 Theodor Adorno、Walter Benjamin、Herbert Marcuse 等学者提出的关于工业社会中流行文化大众化的理论。依照该观点，工业大规模生产、饱和式广告投放以及大众传媒共同塑造了一个同质化的大众受众群体，他们如同羊群般麻木地消费着接连涌现的大众文化产品（Jay 173-218）。在大众化过程中，所有多样化的先前存在的民间和地区流行形式——根据大众化理论家的说法——正在被消灭或收编进日益同质化的大众文化中，例如，由 1940 年代的 Tin Pan Alley 流行音乐和 Hollywood 电影所代表。Herbert Marcuse 于 1964 年出版的畅销书《One-Dimensional Man》书名精准捕捉了大众化个体的形象。但正如 Wilensky、Gans 及 Swingewood 等学者所指出的，大众化理论家对其所描绘的幽灵般图景仅提供了零散的轶事证据。

Indeed a number of researchers who had grown up in the United States in the 1950s, including Denisoff and myself, found little empirical evidence for "massification" and purposefully used the term "popular" rather than "mass" culture to stress the voluntaristic nature of popular culture choices.[^1] Insofar as there were "outside forces" shaping popular music, Denisoff and I both showed that they were to be found not in some abstract force of massification but in clearly identifiable elements of the structure and operation of the music industry itself.[^2] And rather than show some linear trend toward massification, the workings of the culture industry in interaction with audiences and the larger society seemed to show dialectical cycles in symbol production.[^3]

> 确实，许多在 1950 年代在美国长大的研究人员，包括 Denisoff 和我，发现很少有经验证据支持“大众化”，因而有意识地使用“流行”文化而非“大众”文化这一术语，以强调大众文化选择的自愿性质。就塑造流行音乐的“外部力量”而言，Denisoff 和我都表明，这些力量并非存在于某种抽象的大众化力量中，而是存在于音乐产业本身的结构和运作中清晰可辨的元素里。而且，文化产业的运作在与受众和更广泛社会的互动中，似乎显示出符号生产的辩证循环，而非朝向大众化的线性趋势。

At about the same time a number of young researchers working in England reported their observations among diverse youth groups including Mods, Teds, Rockers, Skinheads, Rastas, and Rudies (see Hall and Jefferson). Again contrary to the received theories of massification, they showed how these diverse groups of young people appropriated and adapted elements of mass-produced popular culture to fashion clearly distinct group identities marking themselves off from each other as well as from conformist middle-class youth. Grounded in this work, Dick Hebidge and Simon Frith showed the central place of popular music in the formation and expression of these politically resistant subcultures.

> 大约在同一时间，一些在英格兰工作的年轻研究人员报告了他们对各种青年群体的观察，包括 Mods、Teds、Rockers、Skinheads、Rastas 和 Rudies（参见 Hall 和 Jefferson）。这再次与普遍接受的大众化理论相悖，他们展示了这些不同的年轻人群体如何挪用和改编大众生产的流行文化元素，以塑造清晰独特的群体身份，从而将他们彼此以及与墨守成规的中产阶级青年区分开来。在此项工作的基础上，Dick Hebidge 和 Simon Frith 展示了流行音乐在这些具有政治抵抗性的亚文化形成和表达中的核心地位。

Two conclusions that fly in the face of the prediction of massification can be drawn from all this research of two decades ago. First, the mass production of popular music does not necessarily make for an increasingly homogeneous popular music. Clearly the homogeneity or diversity of popular music is historically variable, Second, the mass production of music does not make for the mass consumption of music. While there are fads, and trends, and manias, people transform popular music as they appropriate it and make it their own.

> 从二十年前的所有这些研究中，可以得出两个与大众化预测相悖的结论。首先，流行音乐的大规模生产并不必然导致流行音乐日益同质化。显然，流行音乐的同质性或多样性是随着历史变化的。其次，音乐的大规模生产并不会导致音乐的大规模消费。虽然有时尚、潮流和狂热，但人们在挪用流行音乐并使其成为自己的东西时，会对其进行改造。

A great deal of more recent work shows the durability of the first conclusion. For example, Ennis argues that rock did not overtake and supplant pop music but formed a "seventh stream" among the other forms of commercial music. Lopes has persuasively shown that the multinational record forms that achieved oligopolistic control of the popular music industry in the mid-1980s have nonetheless marketed a diverse range of musical styles signaling a complete restructuring of the industry since the 1960s (Peterson and Berger, "Measuring"). Also, Goodwin, and Ryan and Peterson, have shown the potentially democratizing influences of the computer-based music-making technologies.

> 许多近期的研究都表明了第一个结论的持久性。例如，Ennis 认为摇滚音乐并没有超越并取代流行音乐，而是在其他形式的商业音乐中形成了“第七股势力”。Lopes 有说服力地表明，在 20 世纪 80 年代中期对流行音乐产业形成寡头垄断控制的跨国唱片公司，却仍然推销了各种各样的音乐风格，这标志着自 20 世纪 60 年代以来该行业已经完全重组（Peterson 和 Berger，"Measuring"）。此外，Goodwin、Ryan 和 Peterson 也展示了基于计算机的音乐制作技术可能带来的民主化影响。

As for the second conclusion concerning consumption, a large number of more recent studies could be cited showing the selectivity and patterning of reception. For example, Hakanen and Wells, surveying the students in one large high school, have shown the diversity of musical taste cultures among this relatively homogeneous aggregation of adolescents. Peterson and Kern have shown something of the range of difference kinds of country music fans, and Bethany Bryson has shown that people use the expressed dislikes for specific kinds of music, as much as they do shared musical preferences, in defining group boundaries. Blau ("Elite" and "High") has contrasted the enduring plurality of popular musics across this country with the singular definition of what comprises classical music and the fine arts generally in all parts of the United States. Given the regional differences in popular culture, she somewhat facetiously concludes that the fine arts constitute our only shared national "mass culture." Peterson ("Understanding") likewise shows the consensually agreed-upon high status of classical music as compared with a diverse range of popular musics at the middle and lower end of the status hierarchy.

> 至于关于消费的第二个结论，可以引用大量更新的研究，这些研究展示了接收的选择性和模式化。例如，Hakanen 和 Wells 对一所大型高中的学生进行了调查，结果显示，在这个相对同质的青少年群体中，音乐品味文化呈现出多样性。Peterson 和 Kern 展示了不同类型乡村音乐迷的差异范围，而Bethany Bryson 则指出，人们在界定群体边界时，对特定音乐类型的厌恶表达与共同的音乐偏好同样重要。Blau（"Elite" 和 "High"）将全国各地流行音乐的持久多样性与美国各地对古典音乐和一般美术的单一界定进行了对比。考虑到流行文化的地域差异，她有些开玩笑地总结说，美术构成了我们唯一共享的全国性“大众文化”。Peterson（"Understanding"）同样表明，与地位等级中下层的各种流行音乐相比，古典音乐具有公认的高地位。

Clearly, therefore, popular culture is plural. And it seems destined to remain so for the foreseeable future, given the minutely differentiated segmentation of the contemporary commercial music emarket, given the great number of CD reissues of every kind of music in the 20th century, and given the proliferation of modes of distribution from cable television to the Internet.

> 因此，显然，大众文化是多元的。在可预见的未来，它似乎注定会保持这种状态，因为当代商业音乐电子市场进行了细致的差异化细分，因为 20 世纪各种音乐的 CD 再版数量众多，也因为从有线电视到互联网的传播模式激增。

Recognizing that popular music remains plural, there is still a world of things we, as researchers, don't know about this plurality. There are, for example, enduring differences in the ways that music is made for the rap, rock, reggae, and country music markets,[^4] but we still know very little about the structure and sources of these differences.

> 我们作为研究人员虽然认识到流行音乐仍然是多元的，但是对于这种多元性仍然有很多不了解的地方。例如，为说唱、摇滚、雷鬼和乡村音乐市场创作音乐的方式存在持久的差异，但我们对这些差异的结构和来源仍然知之甚少。

If anything, our understanding of how music is selected, enjoyed, and understood by people is even less clear. What *is* clear is that the standard categories such as rock and country are virtually meaningless. Take for example, three "county" artists: Hank Williams, Jr., Vince Gill, and k. d. lang. Persons who choose any one of these are very unlikely to like the other two. Those who choose Hank Williams, Jr., are likely to also like Steve Earle and Nine Inch Nails; those who choose Vince Gill are likely to add Mary Chapin Carpenter and the likes of Aaron Neville as well as romantic pop singers; those who choose k. d. lang are likely to select other feminist and lesbian artists who have never flirted with country music.

> 不仅如此，我们对人们如何选择、欣赏和理解音乐的理解甚至更不清楚。清楚的是，诸如摇滚和乡村等标准类别几乎毫无意义。以三位“乡村”艺术家为例——Hank Williams, Jr.、Vince Gill 和 k. d. lang——选择其中任何一位的人，很可能不喜欢另外两位。那些选择 Hank Williams, Jr. 的人，也很可能喜欢 Steve Earle 和 Nine Inch Nails；那些选择 Vince Gill 的人，也很可能会喜欢 Mary Chapin Carpenter 和 Aaron Neville 等人以及浪漫流行歌手；那些选择 k. d. lang 的人，也很可能会选择其他从未涉足乡村音乐的女权主义和女同性恋艺术家。

Even if the plurality is considered postmodernist bricolage, the question still remains, which bricks are selected together by some groups of people and which are rejected only to be picked up and formed into other meaningful structures? Thus, as I see it, the exciting research challenge now is to learn how this vast plurality of popular music is sorted and recombined by artists, by the people in the industry, and by diverse elements of the consuming public and to find what people's popular music choices mean to them.

> 即使这种多元性被认为是后现代主义的拼凑，问题依然存在，哪些“砖块”被某些群体一起选择，哪些又被拒绝，只为了被拾起并形成其他有意义的结构？因此，在我看来，现在激动人心的研究挑战是学习这种庞大的流行音乐多样性是如何被艺术家、行业内人士以及消费大众的不同元素进行分类和重组的，并找出人们的流行音乐选择对他们意味着什么。

# Notes

[^1]: The early works of mine that were motivated by an interest in massification, and found good evidence to refute it, include Peterson ("Process"), Peterson and Berger ("Cycles"), and Peterson and DiMaggio.  

[^2]: See Denisoff (Solid and Tarnished), Peterson and Berger ("Cycles" and "Entrepreneurship"), and Peterson ("Why"). The influence of the industry in shaping popular music is also focal in the books of that era by Charlie Gillett, and Steve Chapple and Reebee Garofalo.  

[^3]: See especially Peterson and Berger ("Cycles") and Peterson ("Process," "Production," and "Dialectic").  

[^4]: This point is clear from conversations with Keith Negus, who is studying how the major record companies "run" the divisions making each of these kinds of music.  

[^5]:  This information is based on interviews with students and informal surveys of the music preferences of Vanderbilt University students and persons attending concerts in the Lower Right region of the United States.
