He has written numerous articles on racism, censorship, the political uses of music, and the globalization of the music industry. His most recent book is *Rockin' Out: Popular Music in the USA* (Allyn and Bacon, 1997). For relaxation, he enjoys drumming and singing with the Blue Suede Boppers, a fifties rock and roll band.

Like any culture industry in a market economy, the role of the music business is fundamentally to transform its cultural products into financial rewards. This process, of course, has been significantly influenced by the technological advances that have determined the production, dissemination, and reception of music. To understand the trajectory of popular music in the twentieth century from its beginnings as a nation-based, mass cultural phenomenon to its current state as part of a global system of interactive, transnational cultural flows, one must trace the uneven relationship between cultural development, technological advancement, professional organization, political struggle, and economic power. Since technological advances and the economic power that drives them have been historically centered in industrialized nations (primarily Great Britain, Western Europe, and the United States), these countries have tended to provide the models for the relationship between popular music and the industry that produces it. Given that two world wars were fought on European soil, with devastating material consequences, at key points in the development of the mass media, the industrialization of popular music has been defined disproportionately by the dominant and often controversial practices of the United States. It is also the case that the pivotal musical moment of the twentieth century in terms of cultural redefinition and structural change in music industry—the eruption of rock and roll—was centered in the United States in the 1950s, and expanded to Great Britain in the 1960s. More recently, however, the relationship between corporate capital and musical culture has transcended national boundaries, as the music industry has become an increasingly global phenomenon.

> 与市场经济中的任何文化产业一样，音乐产业的作用从根本上说就是将其文化产品转化为经济回报。当然，这一过程受到技术进步的显著影响，这些技术进步决定了音乐的制作、传播和接收。要理解 20 世纪流行音乐的轨迹，从其作为一种基于民族的大众文化现象的开端，到其作为互动性跨国文化流动的全球系统的一部分的当前状态，人们必须追溯文化发展、技术进步、专业组织、政治斗争和经济力量之间不平衡的关系。由于技术进步和驱动它们的经济力量在历史上一直集中在工业化国家（主要是英国、西欧和美国），这些国家倾向于为流行音乐与生产它的产业之间的关系提供模式。鉴于两次世界大战都在欧洲土地上进行，在大众媒体发展的关键时期造成了毁灭性的物质后果，流行音乐的工业化在很大程度上受到美国占主导地位且常常备受争议的做法的影响。同样，20 世纪在文化再定义和音乐产业结构变革方面的关键音乐时刻——摇滚乐的爆发——集中于 20 世纪 50 年代的美国，并于 20 世纪 60 年代扩展到英国。然而，最近，随着音乐产业日益成为一种全球现象，企业资本与音乐文化之间的关系已经超越了国界。


In broad strokes, the history of the music industry can be seen in three phases, each dominated by a different kind of organization:

1. Music publishing houses, which occupied the power center of the industry when sheet music was the primary vehicle for disseminating popular music;  
2. Record companies, which ascended to power as recorded music achieved dominance; and  
3. Transnational entertainment corporations, which promote music as an ever-expanding series of "revenue streams"—record sales, advertising revenue, movie tie-ins, streaming audio on the Internet—no longer tied to a particular sound carrier.

> 概括来说，音乐产业的历史可分为三个阶段，每个阶段都由不同类型的组织主导：
>
> 1. 音乐出版公司，当乐谱是传播流行音乐的主要载体时，它们占据了产业的权力中心；
> 2. 唱片公司，随着录制音乐占据主导地位，它们崛起并掌握了权力；
> 3. 跨国娱乐公司，它们将音乐推广为一系列不断扩大的“收入来源”——唱片销售、广告收入、电影搭售、互联网上的流媒体音频——不再与特定的声音载体绑定。


Because the centrality of record companies has predominated in the second half of the twentieth century, this phase of development remains the popular conception of the music industry, even though its structure has shifted markedly in recent years. Consequently, the prevailing view of the popular music industry is that of record companies at the center, with radio, music videos, live concerts, booking agencies, management firms, indeed musicians themselves, playing various supporting roles. Because some of the major changes in popular music in the twentieth century can be traced to the technological developments that enabled record companies to displace publishing houses as the power center of the music business, the tendency is to use the terms "music industry" and "recording industry" synonymously. Initially, however, they were quite separate and there was little contact between the two.

Throughout the early development of sound recording, sheet music was the main vehicle for the mass dissemination of music and music publishers were at the center of the music business. At this time, the centerpiece of middle-class home entertainment was the piano. From the turn of the twentieth century until the end of World War I, the number of pianos and player pianos manufactured in the United States alone averaged about 300,000 annually[^1]. Recording started as a sideline business, initially given to spoken word comedy, instrumental brass-band releases, and other novelty selections. It is not surprising, then, that the publishers initially regarded the revolution in technology that would eventually transform the production and consumption of popular music as little more than a supplement to their earnings from sheet music. They were too busy enjoying the fruits of a very lucrative, centuries-old relationship with this earlier form of music software.

# Music Publishing: The Origins of an Industry

When Johann Gutenberg invented movable type around 1450, he laid the foundation for the modern music-publishing industry. After his hometown of Mainz was sacked by invading armies shortly after the introduction of his invention, the fledgling printing industry was dispersed, first to France and Italy, and then to England. This was a period of significant social upheaval, involving the establishment of merchant cities throughout Europe, the concomitant expansion of a new middle class, and a growing secularization of church-based cultures. In this process, according to Russell Sanjek, "[c]ontrol of the duplicating process had moved from the hands of the church into those of the entrepreneur. Literature was becoming secularized to meet the demands of its new audience, and music, too, would soon be laicized as its principal patron, the church, was replaced by the public consumer."[^2] Operating under an exclusive contract with the city of Venice, Ottaviano dei Petrucci prepared his first publication, a collection of 96 popular songs (mostly French chansons), which qualified him for the title, the Father of Music Publishing.[^3]

In the new mercantile economy, the dependency of feudal relations and the elitism of the patronage system were gradually replaced by the relative democracy of the marketplace. As sites of manufacturing and central distribution points for merchant ships and caravans from distant lands, medieval cities served as host for diverse cultures. Slowly a pan-European body of literary and musical works appeared. As the financial interests of merchant bookseller-publishers expanded, they began to join forces to lobby for legal protection.

The first copyright law was enacted in Britain in 1710, when Parliament passed the Statute of Anne, the basis for legal protection of intellectual property in the English-speaking world. While the law included an author's copyright and protections for consumers (by limiting the term of copyright and creating a "public domain"), it clearly favored the stationer's guild, which enjoyed royal sanctions granting an effective monopoly on publishing in return for cooperation in ferreting out and suppressing seditious literary or musical material. In this reciprocal arrangement, booksellers fared considerably better than authors or composers. It wasn't until the end of the eighteenth century, according to Finkelstein, "that composers were able to actually make an important part of their living from the printing and sale of their music."[^4] This coincided with the growth of a domestic market for pianos and the establishment of the instrument as a cultural status symbol throughout Europe.

By the nineteenth century, music-publishing interests had begun to turn their attention toward international copyright systems because, as Dave Laing has pointed out, "music, more than other arts, easily crossed national linguistic and cultural boundaries."[^5] Britain enacted its first International Copyright Act in 1838 and extended its provisions to include music in 1842. In the latter half of the nineteenth century there ensued a number of multilateral meetings across the continent among members of the music trade which culminated in the Berne Convention of 1886. Berne was essentially a treaty that provided for reciprocal recognition of copyright among sovereign nations. Seven of the initial nine signatories to the Berne Convention were European. Since 1886 the convention has been amended six times essentially to keep pace with the emergence of new technologies: Berlin (1908) incorporated photography, film, and sound recording; Rome (1928) added broadcasting; Brussels (1948), television. By 1993 there were almost 100 signatories to the Berne Convention.[^6] Significantly, the United States did not sign on until 1988, more than 100 years after the founding convention.

At the time of Berne, U.S. popular music was only just beginning to come into its own, primarily through blackface minstrelsy and the works of Stephen Foster, which became popular throughout Europe. In the balance of trade, the United States would still have been showing a net loss on the import/export ratio of cultural products; it was not yet in the interest of the United States to embrace reciprocal arrangements with foreign publishers. Within a short time, however, U.S. music publishers would consolidate their operations into the most efficient music machine the world had yet seen—Tin Pan Alley.

At a time when European art music was considered to be superior to popular selections, U.S. music publishers derived their income from the manufacture and sale of classical scores, many of which were in the public domain, and, increasingly, through original popular compositions. In the United States, sheet music retailied for about thirty to forty cents a copy and, for the major publishers, sales in the hundreds of thousands of copies were not unheard of. Charles K. Harris's "After the Ball," written and published in 1892, "quickly reached sales of $25,000 a week," and, according to Charles Hamm, "sold more than 2,000,000 copies in only several years, eventually achieving a sale of some five million."[^7] During this period, the previously scattered conglomeration of U.S. publishing houses, who would dominate mainstream popular music until the Second World War, were beginning to converge on the area of New York City that came to be known as Tin Pan Alley, after the tinny output of its upright pianos. Tin Pan Alley anticipated many of the practices of the music business in later years—and therefore provides the clearest model for how business would be conducted.

While it is noteworthy that in less than twenty years leading up to the turn of the century, Tin Pan Alley centralized control of an industry that had been spread throughout major cities across the United States, it is perhaps more important that Tin Pan Alley produced only popular songs. Unlike the older, more traditional music-publishing houses, which issued a broad range of material, the "song factories" of Tin Pan Alley promoted an overwhelmingly successful formulaic pop mentality that yielded "a much more homogeneous style than had ever before been the case in the history of song in America."[^8] If the songwriting style of Tin Pan Alley was distinctive, its success was due in equal measure to its aggressive marketing tactics. Tin Pan Alley publishers routinely visited popular venues, offering star performers everything from personal favors to songwriting credits to include a particular song in their acts. Such an investment could be returned many-fold in sheet-music sales.

As was the case with publishing enterprises elsewhere, at this stage in its development Tin Pan Alley turned its attention toward legal protection. While these publishers clearly saw sheet music as their stock-in-trade—and, as a result, never fully embraced records—they saw no reason why their income shouldn't be supplemented with revenues from record sales. Thus, at the end of the first decade of the twentieth century—when it was clear that records were becoming a force to be reckoned with—there ensued a widespread revision of existing copyright laws to accommodate the new medium. In 1909, following the Berlin revision to the Berne Convention, Victor Herbert and John Philip Sousa led the charge for a revision to the U.S. copyright laws which mandated a royalty of two cents for each cylinder, record, or piano roll manufactured, in addition to revenues already derived from live performances. Because the U.S. Copyright Act of 1909 used the language of "mechanical reproduction," these new fees came to be known as a "mechanicals." Comparable laws were passed in Britain in 1911 and elsewhere on the continent at around the same time.

To recover their sources of revenue more efficiently, publishers in the industrialized world, in alliance with composers and songwriters, began to organize themselves into professional associations known in the trade as performing rights organizations. France had anticipated this development, forming the Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique (SACEM) in 1850. Italy and Austria followed suit before the turn of the century. Three other industrialized music-producing nations came on board before World War I. Publishers in Great Britain formed the Performing Rights Society (PRS), and in Germany, Geselteschaft für Musikalische Aufführungs (GEMA). The Tin Pan Alley publishers established the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) in 1914. In 1926 these various national societies formed an international confederation, Confédération Internationale des Sociétés Auteurs et Compositeurs (CISAC), headquartered in France.

In general, in their formative stages performing rights organizations were exclusive societies with national monopolies on copyrighted music. Membership in ASCAP, for example, was skewed toward the more "literate" writers of show tunes and semi-serious works such as Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, Cole Porter, George Gershwin, and Irving Berlin. Writers of more vernacular forms, such as the blues and country music, were excluded from ASCAP. As proprietors of the compositions of their members, these organizations exercised considerable power in shaping public taste.

Just as technological advances such as movable type favored industrialized nations, copyright laws kept artistic expression firmly anchored to the European cultural tradition of notated music, in that the claim for royalties was based on the registration of melodies and lyrics, the aspects of music that most readily lend themselves to notation. Artists or countries with musical traditions based on rhythm rather than melody or those that valued improvisation over notation were excluded from the full benefit of copyright protection right from the start. Further, as an extension of literary copyright, musical copyright was based on a conception of authorship, which tended to penalize societies in which composition was conceived as a collective activity.

# Recording Companies: The Commodification of Sound

Although it was clear before the dawn of the twentieth century that the future of the recording industry would be tied to music and entertainment, this was not obvious at first. When Thomas Edison unveiled his legendary "talking machine" in 1877, which is generally considered the birth of recording, the reproduction of music was fourth down his list of intended uses. Edison, as well as most of his competitors, initially saw the phonograph, as he called it, as an office machine, with practical applications in stenography, books for the blind, and teaching elocation. How the fledgling industry gravitated toward music and what they chose to record speaks volumes about the role of the music industry in the production of music.

Edison unwittingly provided a glimpse of the future when he chose to introduce the phonograph by highlighting its novelty value. In countless public demonstrations in Great Britain and the United States, vocalists, whistlers, and local instrumentalists from the audience were invited to make live recordings on the spot, anticipating what would become the dominant use of the invention. Other than the spoken word, it was found that brass reproduced best. Because of the poor sound quality of Edison's early tinfoil cylinders, however, Edison himself dismissed the phonograph as "a mere toy, which has no commercial value"[^9] and put the project on the shelf, but only temporarily.

The next steps in the development of sound recording in the United States were taken in Bell Laboratories and eventually consolidated into the North American Phonograph Company, a national combine focused on office technology. It was Louis Glass, manager of North American's West Coast franchise, who pointed the way to the future. Beginning in 1889 Glass placed these "dictating" machines in the Palais Royal Saloon in San Francisco where patrons could listen to a prerecorded "entertainment" cylinder for a nickel. Within a year, these "nickel in the slot" machines were bringing in as much as $1,200 annually. The enterprise earned Glass a place in music history as the Father of the Jukebox.

The Columbia Phonograph Company, North American's District of Columbia franchise, quickly distinguished itself as the leading producer of quality entertainment cylinders. Among those that caught on with the mainstream listening audience were spoken-word comic Irish tales, "coon" songs, which exploited negative stereotypes of African Americans, and brass bands. By 1892 Columbia had issued about 100 recordings of the United States Marine Band, which included Sousa marches and Strauss waltzes, among other favorites.

It was German American immigrant Emile Berliner who first envisaged the contours of the modern music industry full-blown. Berliner had developed a recording process based on a flat disc for a machine he called the gramophone. At its very first demonstration in 1888, Berliner prophesied the ability to make an unlimited number of copies from a single master, the development of a mass-scale home-entertainment market for recorded music, and a system of royalty payments to artists derived from the sale of discs.[^10]

During this same time frame, similar developments were being undertaken elsewhere in the industrialized world. The work of Charles and Emile Pathé in Paris paralleled the development of the Edison phonograph. Opening their first phonograph factory in the Paris suburb of Chatou in 1894, Pathé Frères became a full-fledged recording company in 1897. That same year William Barry Owen left his position as head of Berliner's National Gramophone Company in New York and established the Gramophone Company in London to exploit the Berliner European gramophone patents. Deutsche Grammophon, another related company, was set up by Joseph Berliner in Hanover, Germany. Then, in 1901, Emile Berliner founded the Victor Talking Machine Company in the United States.

Even though these companies knew that they were headed for entertainment—not dictation—the fledgling industry faced a number of serious roadblocks—technical, legal, and financial. Because of their limited sound quality, early recordings tended to favor spoken-word and instrumental selections; writers and publishers were not yet entitled to receive royalties from the sale or use of recorded music; and, because cylinders couldn’t yet be mass produced, manufacturing couldn’t compete with the consumer demand that already existed for sheet music. In addition, a series of patent wars prevented the industry from progressing smoothly. After the turn of the century, however, the major recording companies determined that pooling their patents would advance the technology, as well as their economic self-interest, far more rapidly and, in the process, provide them with a form of oligopolistic control of the industry.

Emile Berliner delivered on his first prophecy when he made negative discs called "stampers," which evolved into the shellac-based, 78-rpm pressings that went on to become the industry standard until the late 1940s. He then contracted with an enterprising machinist named Eldridge R. Johnson, who developed a competitive twenty-five-dollar machine, creating the possibility of a home-entertainment market for records. To realize his second prophecy, Berliner judged correctly that he would need someone with more musical ability than himself to coordinate talent and recording. A single demonstration of the "beautiful round tones" of Berliner's disc was enough to lure Columbia's Fred Gaisberg—in effect, the first a&R (artist and repertoire) man/producer—to Victor.

If Berliner was the industrial visionary, Gaisberg provided the cultural input. Because recording artists weren't yet paid royalties and received no credit on records or in catalogues, Gaisberg had relatively little trouble persuading popular Columbia artists to record for Victor. Neither was he limited to performers in the United States. Gaisberg had already set up the first recording studio in London in 1898 before he moved from Columbia to Victor. Then in the early 1900s Victor acquired 50 percent ownership of the British Gramophone Company.[^11] Through the efforts of William Barry Owen, Gaisberg was soon recording in every music capital in Europe and Russia.

Because of an elitist bias toward high culture, European classical music was considered to be the hallmark of good taste and opera singers occupied the highest rung on the entertainment ladder. Accordingly, the British Gramophone Company catalogue included songs and arias in every European language and many Asian languages as well. Gaisberg also made recordings at the Imperial Opera in Russia. In 1902 Italian tenor Enrico Caruso recorded ten arias in a hotel room in Milan for Gramophone, helping to establish the company as a serious outlet for classical as well as popular music. Eldridge Johnson imported these higher priced "Red Seal" recordings for sale in the United States and then began a domestic Red Label series of his own, which featured the stars of the Metropolitan Opera in New York.[^12] Producer C. G. Childs placed a jewel in the crown of the new series when he signed Caruso to an exclusive Victor contract by offering him the unprecedented provision of a royalty on records sold, thereby fulfilling the last of Berliner's 1888 prophecies.

In the 1910s the recording industry extended its tentacles into the most lucrative markets of the world, through pressing plants in the most important areas and through a network of subsidiaries elsewhere. The two largest and most powerful companies, U.S. Victor and British Gramophone, furthered their mutual interests by dividing portions of the globe cooperatively. Victor had the Americas, North and South, and what they called the Far East; Gramophone operated factories in Europe, Russia, and India. After the outbreak of World War I the assets of Deutsche Grammophon were confiscated by the German government as enemy property, forcing a split between the British and German companies. By this time, however, Germany's Lindström company had become an international player and Pathé was not far behind.[^13]

By this time, it was clear that records would become a powerful cultural force. In 1909, the United States alone manufactured more than 27 million discs and cylinders, with a wholesale value of nearly S12 million.[^14] Comparable figures from around the world were equally impressive. One observer estimated German record production at 18 million copies (including exports) in 1907, Russian sales at 20 million copies in 1915, and the British and French markets at 10 million units each in the same time frame.[^15] It was figures such as these which caused the publishers to stand up and take notice.

While the economic vision of the major record companies was nothing short of world domination, their cultural strategy at this time was seemingly more democratic. All of the major companies not only exported their own domestic products internationally, they also recorded and distributed local artists in the countries where they operated, "so that by the early 1910s, Icelandic, Estonian, Welsh and Breton record buyers, the ethnic minorities of the Russian Empire, the twenty largest immigrant groups in the United States, and the most important groups of the Indian subcontinent were all supplied by recordings of their own musical traditions."[^16] Given the history of European colonialism and patterns of racism in the United States, however, it is likely that this broad range of cultural products resulted more from considerations of cost effectiveness than a commitment to cultural diversity.

It is also the case that there were (and are) pronounced biases in the way that the music industry conceived of itself and its world. Africa (with the occasional exception of South Africa) and certain other locales are conspicuously absent in much of the writing about the early internationalization of the music industry. Even within the industrialized world, there was internal class and race stratification. Record companies were slow to learn the cultural lesson that while the European classics brought prestige to their labels, the steady income—indeed, the future of the recording industry—was tied more to popular appetites. Victor's prestigious Red Seal series never accounted for more than 20 percent of the sales of the popular black-label recordings.[^17] While the record companies grappled with the tension between an elite conception of culture and the financial realities of popular taste, many rich sources of musical culture went beneath their notice, particularly within regions that were insufficiently penetrated by capital and/or populations that were too poor to be thought of as consumers.

Significant cultural blind spots notwithstanding, by the 1910s the recording industry was clearly in an ascending phase, one which, with numerous fits and starts, would continue. The addition of a mechanical royalty to the copyright laws in the early twentieth century was timely in that it opened the door for collaborations between publishers and recording companies which had not existed previously. Companies in Great Britain and the United States were particularly well served, as a lucrative market for musical theater albums was discovered among American soldiers and native Britons during World War I when Gramophone issued a recording of the songs from Business as Usual, a popular musical revue. This was followed by recordings of two of Irving Berlin's shows, Watch Your Step and Cheep, with equal success. Victor emulated the success of its British partner by recording the best-known stage entertainers in the United States. Columbia and Edison soon followed suit.

It should be noted that there were distinctions between the new copyright laws which differentially affected the standing of record companies in different countries. While both the U.S. and British revisions added mechanical rights to already existing performing rights, enabling publishers to extend their reach to a new medium, the British law also included language that was later used to argue for an additional right, referred to somewhat confusingly as a "performance right," which enabled record companies to claim a copyright that inheres in the recording itself "as if such contrivances were musical works."[^18] The performance right allows a record company to recover a royalty when a record is used for a public performance, as in a jukebox or on the radio. In Great Britain, Phonographic Performance Ltd. (PPL) was set up to administer these payments and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) was established to lobby other governments for similar provisions in their domestic laws.

While a number of countries adopted copyright provisions similar to Great Britain's, others—such as France and the United States—did not acknowledge a copyright in records as such.[^19] Performance rights were hotly debated in the 1976 revision to the U.S. Copyright Law, but even at that late date Congress decided that the issue required further study. Consequently, no provision was included in the final legislation; indeed, Section 114 (a) states explicitly that the owner's rights "do not include any right of performance," effectively killing the measure. The failure to adopt a performance right has serious consequences, particularly for recording artists with a signature sound, which were made clear in the report of the House Judiciary Committee on the 1976 legislation. "Mere imitation of a recorded performance would not constitute a copyright infringement," said the committee, "even where one performer deliberately sets out to simulate another's performance as exactly as possible."[^20]

In addition to the complexity of performing rights, performance rights, and mechanicals, the 1928 Rome revision to the Berne Convention introduced the concept of "moral rights," which granted an author the right to be properly identified and guarded against any editing or other alteration of a work that would compromise its integrity. As with other provisions of Berne, however, the moral rights provision was optional. Again, the United States was significant among the countries that opted out of this provision, even after it signed on to Berne.

Amid the growing complexity of the music industry, it appeared as though the market for recorded music was virtually unlimited. Gross revenues in the United States hit an all-time high of $106 million in 1921, with comparable growth being reported elsewhere in the industrialized world. The expiration of the original talking-machine patents in the mid-teens enabled a number of new companies to enter the record business. Unsated consumer demand in the areas of blues and country music—known at the time as race and hillbilly—even allowed for the formation of some Black-owned indies such as Black Swan, Sunshine, Merritt, and Black Patti. Pathé opened a branch in New York and Lindström started OKeh Records. At this point, however, the U.S. record market stalled—even as record sales were still climbing in other countries. Two years after the advent of commercial radio broadcasting in 1920, annual record revenues in the United States declined immediately and then plummeted to an all-time low of $6 million in 1933, at the height of the Great Depression. By this time the depression had adversely affected all record-producing nations. To avoid bankruptcy, British Gramophone merged with the Columbia Graphophone Company (the European arm of U.S.-based Columbia) to form Electric and Musical Industries (EMI). In the United States, the major radio networks acquired their first record divisions; RCA merged with Victor in 1929 and CBS bought Columbia Records in the mid-thirties. As is often the case in the music business, technological advances have a way of changing existing power relationships and influencing cultural choices. The introduction of radio—a new medium that not only delivered live music with better sound quality than records, but did so free of charge—initially lessened the appeal of records.

# Radio Broadcasting: Empires of the Air

Radio was one of those developments that clearly resulted from an international process of shared knowledge, beginning with the discovery of electromagnetic waves by the German scientist Heinrich Hertz in the early 1890s. Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi developed the first practical applications of "Hertzian waves" in the field of telegraphy and set up shop in Britain and the United States by the beginning of the twentieth century. Canadian Reginald Fessenden led the way from telegraphic to telephonic transmissions, but could not compete with the dramatic broadcasts of phonograph music from the Eiffel Tower (1908) or Caruso from the Metropolitan Opera in New York (1910), engineered by Lee de Forest, an American whose country was determined to dominate the new technology.

Owing to the ascending economic power and military might of the United States following World War I, it disproportionately reaped the benefits of commercial broadcasting (as well as the major technical advances of the next thirty years). During World War I the commercial development of radio was temporarily halted by the Allies in order to devote all further research and application to the war effort. Since this pooling of resources effectively meant a moratorium on patent suits, the war years encouraged technical advances at a crucial period in the development of radio which might not otherwise have been possible. Once the war was over, it was clear that there was a future for radio, and Marconi, headquartered in Britain, set his sights on nothing less than a worldwide monopoly on wireless communication. But the U.S. government felt otherwise.

Because President Woodrow Wilson saw mass communication as a key element in the balance of world power, he found the prospect of a British-dominated monopoly on radio unacceptable. Once the president of American Marconi understood his position, he dryly told his stockholders in 1919, "We have found that there exists on the part of the officials of the [U.S.] Government a very strong and irremovable objection to [American Marconi] because of the stock interest held therein by the British Company.[^21] When all was said and done, the operations and assets of American Marconi had been transferred to a new entity—the Radio Corporation of America (RCA)—a holding company for American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T), who manufactured transmitters, General Electric (GE) and Westinghouse, who made receivers, and the former stockholders of American Marconi.

With future developments in radio firmly in U.S. hands, the advent of broadcasting internationally proceeded according to a number of different models. In their pathbreaking study of the international music industry, Roger Wallis and Krister Malm identified three main types—public service, purely commercial, and government controlled—which are derived from archetypes of the historical development of radio.[^22] In practice none of these ideal types exist in pure form, and many systems were hybrids from the start or changed over time. In France, for example, some early radio stations were operated by the government, while others were owned by schools or private companies. In Germany, a somewhat independent system of educational and entertainment programs was nationalized by the Nazis in 1933 so as to better exploit the value of radio as a unifying political force.

Britain's BBC is generally considered the archetypal public-service system. According to the BBC website, "John Reith, the BBC's founding father, looked westwards in the 1920s to America's unregulated, commercial radio, and then east to the fledgling Soviet Union's rigidly controlled state system. Reith's vision was of an independent British broadcaster able to 'educate, inform and entertain' the whole nation, free from political interference and commercial pressure."[^23] By the time a schedule of daily broadcasts that included drama, news, and children's programs, as well as classical and popular music, went "on the air" over London's 2LO station, more than one million tenshilling listening licenses had been issued to help insure the independence of the enterprise. Still, BBC radio has hardly been free from government intervention in the censorship of popular music.

Telephonic broadcasting began earlier in both the United States and the Soviet Union. During the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, radio stations were considered important assets for the new society. Because of the sheer size of the new federation, the lack of infrastructure, high levels of illiteracy, and the diversity of nationalities, Lenin reasoned quite correctly that radio would provide the most effective means of communicating with the masses. "Every village should have radio," opined Lenin. "Every government office, as well as every club in our factories should be aware that at a certain hour they will hear political news and major events of the day. This way our country will lead a life of highest political awareness, constantly knowing actions of the government and views of the people.[^24] Control of Soviet radio was placed in the hands of the People's Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs and, in 1921, the agency began a series of daily broadcasts called the "Spoken Newspaper of the Russian Telegraph Agency." Because individual receivers were too expensive for private use, loudspeakers were installed in public areas for reception.

Although broadcasting in the United States was conceived as a commercial enterprise from the start, it began with the same lofty rhetoric as the BBC regarding education and raising the general level of culture. In the United States, the tension between such elite notions of culture and the dictates of popular taste played itself out in a pivotal debate between the more dignified old guard programmers and a new breed of unabashedly commercial advertisers.

A regular schedule of broadcasting began in the United States in November of 1920 when the Westinghouse station KDKA went live from the roof of their Pittsburgh factory, reporting the results of the Harding/Cox presidential election. Within two to three years, nearly 600 stations were licensed to operate, with few precedents to guide their development. The existing legislation, designed primarily to govern maritime telegraphy, did not anticipate the impact of commercialized telephonic broadcasting. Issues such as programming, financing, organization, ownership, networking, interference, and advertising were worked out in practice and over time as they arose.

Though U.S. legislation was premised on a system of independent stations, radio quickly became concentrated in the hands of two giant corporations, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and National Broadcasting Company (NBC), a subsidiary of RCA that operated the Red and Blue networks. By the 1930s coast-to-coast network broadcasting was a reality and NBC and CBS already owned 50 of the 52 clear channels—stations with large transmitters positioned to broadcast over great distances with minimal interference—as well as 75 percent of the most powerful regional stations. In terms of ownership patterns, U.S. radio developed as a very private enterprise. Programming, however, was a different matter.

Consistent with radio's educational mission, news and dramatic series had been staples of broadcasting from the beginning, but the bulk of radio programming consisted of music.[^25] While the old-line programmers favored concerts of classical or semi-classical music to nourish the cultural sensibilities of the middle-class audience, the advertisers paid more attention to popular tastes. They tended more toward "dialect" comedy and popular song. In this, they were closer to the inclinations of Tin Pan Alley than those of the programmers, and the popular publishing houses, acting through ASCAP, were quick to reap the benefits.

The advent of commercial advertising placed musical broadcasts within the public-performance-for-profit provision of the 1909 Copyright Act. By the end of 1924 "ASCAP income from 199 radio licenses was  $130,000, up from the previous year's $35,000 but far from the million predicted when the drive to collect from broadcasters began in the summer of 1922."[^26] By 1937 ASCAP's take from radio had jumped to $5.9 million. Considering ASCAP's demands excessive, the broadcasters began an adversarial relationship with the publishers, which led to the formation of a rival performing-rights organization in 1939—Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI)—and which continued well into the 1960s.

No sooner had the broadcasters come to terms with ASCAP than they ran afoul of the American Federation of Musicians, who went to war over the use of "canned music" on radio. Training their sights on the record companies, the AFM struck the recording studios, a strategy intended to hurt record production and, at the same time, keep musicians working on radio. The AFM scored a short-term victory, as the demand for new releases outstripped the supply that the record companies had stockpiled. The strike ended when the record companies agreed to pay a royalty on record sales which was used to finance the Performance Trust Fund for out-of-work musicians. Still, it was inevitable that records would one day replace live musicians on radio.

If the political economy of radio seemed far removed from the average listener, its social functions often touched people deeply. During the Depression, wrote Erik Barnouw, radio won "a loyalty that seemed almost irrational. Destitute families that had to give up an icebox or furniture or bedding still clung to the radio as to a last link with humanity."[^27] This reality was hardly wasted on President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the first "radio president," whose popular "Fireside Chats" provided him with a national following throughout his tenure in office.

Not unlike the Bolsheviks or the Nazis, Roosevelt immediately grasped the ideological potential of radio; in 1942 he authorized the Armed Forces Radio Service to keep U.S. troops stationed abroad informed and entertained, and to mount a direct challenge to the opposing ideology promoted by the likes of Axis Sally and Tokyo Rose. By 1945 the AFRS had expanded to a network of 150 outlets that crisscrossed the globe, with weekly shipments of news and music programming being distributed from its Los Angeles Broadcast Center. In this way a steady diet of U.S. military reportage as well as a sizable dose of U.S. popular culture were broadcast around the world.[^28]

On the homefront, the tension between high and popular culture in music programming had taken a turn toward the popular in one of the most interesting national prime-time experiments of the period—Your Hit Parade on NBC. Tapping into audience responses for programming decisions, the sponsor directed B. A. Rolfe and his thirty-five-piece orchestra to play only popular dance music with "no extravagant, bizarre, involved arrangements," so as to insure the "foxtrotability" of every selection programmed.[^29] In focusing solely on musical selections that were popular among the listening audience, Your Hit Parade was the first show to confer power in determining public taste on the consumer. Their " listener preference" letters foreshadowed the more "scientific" methods of rating that would eventually determine official popularity charts and format radio programming.

The tension between the "elevated" cultural tendencies of radio's old guard programmers and the straight commercial entertainment favored by the advertisers continued for years. Ultimately, the balance of power in programming favored the advertisers. As a result, radio has tended to follow the popular tastes of consumers, a tendency that had unanticipated consequences as rock and roll emerged in the early 1950s.

# Technological Advances and Structural Change

A number of advances in audio technology that came into widespread usage in the 1940s set the stage for the emergence of rock and roll and major structural changes in the music industry. Among these were the inventions of magnetic tape and the transistor, and the advent of microgroove recording.

The concept and equipment for magnetic recording were first patented by the Danish engineer Valdemar Poulsen in 1898, but it was the Germans who perfected it. The German magnetophone developed by Telefunken and BASF used plastic tape coated with iron oxide, which could be magnetized by amplified electrical impulses to encode a signal on the material. Playback simply reversed the process. Aside from the obvious technical advantages of editing, splicing, and better sound reproduction, magnetic tape recording was also more durable, more portable, and less expensive than the existing technologies. The Nazis used the new technology to increase propaganda broadcasts during World War II, but there was no immediate application to the music industry, as the studios and manufacturing plants of Deutsche Grammophon (now owned by Seimens) in Berlin and Hanover had been destroyed by saturation bombing. As Germany rebuilt after the war, Deutsche Grammophon became the first company to use magnetic tape exclusively.

Among the spoils of the war, magnetic tape was one of the items that was "liberated" from the Nazis. In the United States, the main beneficiary was the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), who came up with a tape that surpassed the sound quality of the German product and marketed it under their Scotch Tape trademark. Simultaneously, tape-recorder manufacturers were able to reduce recording speeds from thirty inches per second (ips) to fifteen ips and then to seven-and-a-half ips, without seriously compromising sound quality. The amount of material that could be recorded on a standard tape thus quadrupled. The advantages of tape were immediately apparent to recording companies and radio stations, who invested in the technology as soon as it became available.

A welcome companion to the new recording technology was the transistor, introduced by U.S.-based Bell Telephone in 1948. Until the transistor, the amplification needed for radio broadcasting and electronic recording was tied to cumbersome and fragile vacuum tubes—a component based on Lee de Forest's audion, capable of generating, modulating, amplifying, and detecting radio energy. The transistor was capable of performing all the functions of the vacuum tube but in a solid environment. As such, it could be made smaller, required less power, and was more durable than the vacuum tube, which was soon replaced. This advance encouraged decentralization in broadcasting and recording, which aided independent production. On the consumption side, the transistor made possible truly portable radio receivers. Teenagers, who were soon to become an identifiable consumer group, could now explore their developing musical tastes in complete privacy.

The same year that the transistor was unveiled, a team of scientists working at CBS labs under the leadership of Dr. Peter Goldmark and William Bachman invented "high fidelity." Developed out of their interest in classical music, this breakthrough yielded the "microgroove" or "long-playing" 33-rpm record (the LP), which increased the number of grooves per inch on a standard record from eighty-five to three hundred. Not to be outdone, RCA responded with a similar product that played at 45 rpm. In what became known as the "battle of the speeds," the competition between the two giant firms produced vinylite discs of excellent sound quality and maximum durability. The 45, whose size caught the fancy of jukebox manufacturers, soon became the preferred configuration for singles. The LP became the industry standard for albums. Because these records were lighter and less breakable than shellac-based 78s, they could be shipped faster and more cheaply. Particularly because of these technological advances, records emerged as a relatively inexpensive medium, which held out the very real possibility of decentralization in the recording industry.

Two policy decisions in the United States also had implications for the further development of popular music and the music industry. Owing to a shellac shortage during the war, which caused a cutback on the number of records that could be produced, the major U.S. labels made a strategic decision to abandon the production of African American music. This decision, coupled with technological advances favoring decentralization, created the conditions in the 1940s under which literally hundreds of small independent labels—among them Atlantic, Chess, Sun, King, Modern, Specialty, and Imperial—came into existence in the United States.

Another important policy decision—leading to the development of television—enabled these fledgling labels to gain a permanent foothold in the industry. The concept of transmitting images over distances had been around since the nineteenth century. As early as 1926 John Logie Baird experimented with a mechanical television system that became the basis for the BBC's first televisual transmissions. The current system of electronic television was first proposed by Scottish inventor A. A. Campbell-Swinton in 1908. It was developed in earnest in the United States at Westinghouse by Vladimir K. Zworykin, a refugee from the Bolshevik Revolution, using a cathode-ray tube invented by Karl Ferdinand Braun in Germany in 1897. In 1935 RCA decided to sink S1 million into the development of the new medium. One year later the BBC began its first regular public television broadcasts.

Television became a viable consumer item in the United States in the late 1940s. By 1951 there were nearly 16 million television sets in operation and RCA had already recovered its initial investment. Television signaled the death knell for network radio, as the new visual medium quickly attracted most of the national advertising. Interestingly, this had the effect of strengthening local independent radio, which emerged as the most effective vehicle for local advertisers—at a time when the number of radio stations in the United States had doubled from about 1,000 in 1946 to about 2,000 in 1948.

Local radio in the late forties and early fifties was a very loosely structured scene. Independent deejays—or "personality jocks" as they were called—were in control. As they replaced the live-entertainment personalities who dominated radio in the thirties and early forties, they became, for a time, the pivotal figures in the music industry. Relying on their own inventiveness for popularity, independent deejays often experimented with alternatives to the standard pop fare of network radio. In most cases the key to their musical success turned out to be rhythm and blues—the direct precursor of rock and roll—produced by independent labels.

The relationship between local radio and record companies also contributed to a major structural change in the music business. In the era of network radio, music was performed live by studio orchestras. In its search for cheaper forms of programming, however, independent radio turned to recorded music. The dawn of a new age was apparent when WINS in New York announced in 1950, over the strong objection of the American Federation of Musicians (AFM), that it would be programming records exclusively from then on. Since recorded music was now the rule for radio, record companies routinely supplied free copies of new releases to deejays in the hope that they could turn them into hits. Eventually, this practice cemented the reciprocal arrangement between radio and record companies that has defined the music industry ever since: inexpensive programming in return for free promotion.

Records became not only the staple of all radio programming but also the dominant product of the music industry as a whole, eclipsing sheet music as the dominant medium for music. Record companies thus displaced publishing houses as the power center of the music industry. Further, with technological advances favoring decentralization in recording and a climate of experimentation in radio, it became possible for small independent labels to challenge the few giant corporations that had monopolized the music business until this time. The stage was set for the emergence of rock and roll.

# Cultural Transformation and Structural Change

The eruption of rock and roll in the 1950s changed the popular music landscape permanently and irrevocably, signaling the advent of broader social change to come. It was a pivotal moment for a number of reasons. Economically, the music enhanced the fortunes of "untutored" artists, upstart independent record companies, and wildly eccentric deejays, turning the structure of the music business on its head. The vintage rock-and-roll years coincided with a period when the fortunes of the U.S. music industry nearly tripled; revenues from record sales climbed from  $213 million in 1954 to $603 million in 1959. In this expansion, rock and roll jumped from a 15.7 percent share of the pop market in 1955 to a 42.7 percent share in 1959. During the same time period, independent record companies went from a 21.6 percent share of the pop market in 1955 to a 66.3 percent share of a pop market that was roughly three times larger in 1959. Rock and roll was clearly a threat to established music business interests economically. But it was a threat to the whole society culturally and politically.

As a rhythm-dominant music that placed a high aesthetic value on repetition and improvisation, rock and roll represented a hybrid form that favored African ways of making music over European. As such, it created a space for African American artists in mainstream culture that had not previously existed. Further, as a music steeped in regional accents, slurred syllables, and urban slang, it foregrounded working-class sensibilities in opposition to elite notions of culture and Tin Pan Alley's white, middle-class orientation. Finally, it was the first music marketed directly to youth; its performers were roughly the same age as its audience. This, coupled with the rebellious tone of the music, created the first publicly identified generation gap in society at large.

Despite various efforts to tame the music in the late fifties, rock and roll became even more highly politicized in the 1960s, as baby boomers came of age and the music became identified with radical youth movements throughout the world. By this time the music associated with the "British Invasion," its name now shortened to "rock," had made a major contribution, elevating the music to the status of art, even as it became more closely linked with alternative and oppositional tendencies. A whole new broadcast medium—FM rock radio—and a burgeoning rock press opened up to accommodate these new sounds. But, just as the radical movements of the sixties depended in part on the affluence provided by imperialist practices, popular music was inextricably bound to the capitalist interests that produced it. "From the start," said Michael Lydon in 1970, "rock has been commercial in its very essence. . . . [I]t was never an art form that just happened to make money, nor a commercial undertaking that sometimes became art. Its art was synonymous with its business."[^30]

The 1960s may have been experienced by artists and audiences as a period of political awakening and cultural development, but for the music industry it was a period of commercial expansion and corporate consolidation. Far from disappearing, as the activists of the 1960s would have had it, capitalism simply became hipper. There was a new wisdom among corporate executives in the music industry. As it became clear that the key to profitability lay in manufacturing and distribution, record companies began contracting out most of the creative functions of music making. Far from resisting the creative impulses of offbeat artists or upstart independent labels, the major companies now signed acts directly, made label deals, entered into joint ventures, or contracted for distribution.

There ensued a period of unprecedented merger mania. Steve Chapple and I identified three types of mergers: horizontal, vertical, and conglomerate.[^31] In reality, of course, such ideal types were often hybrids as in the amalgamation of Warner-Reprise, Elektra-Asylum, and Atlantic in the creation of the Warner Communications empire. By the early 1970s a couple of dozen associated labels—in addition to extensive holdings in film and television, Mad magazine, sixty-three comic books, and a piece of Ms. magazine—were operating under the new corporate umbrella. CBS integrated vertically to control production and marketing from recording to retail sales. In addition to its own labels, recording studios, pressing plants, national distribution, and a publishing division, CBS, Inc. owned the Columbia Record and Tape Club, Pacific Stereo and the Discount Records chain, Fender Guitars, Leslie Speakers, Rhodes Pianos, and Rogers Drums. In Britain EMI had acquired an analogous set of holdings.

RCA, CBS, and EMI, which had purchased Capitol in 1955, had long been divisions of multinational electronics conglomerates. In the early 1970s they were joined by another electronics-related multinational corporation. Seimens and the Dutch conglomerate Philips had begun to merge their recording interests in the early sixties. In 1971 they combined to form PolyGram, which included MGM and Mercury. In 1980 they added British Decca. The structure of this multinational "Big Five"—four electrics giants plus Warner Communications—formed the basis for the new international music industry in the 1980s, as the business of music became an increasingly global phenomenon.

Meanwhile, the predominance of electronics firms in the music field created an issue, which seemed particularly antithetical to the prevailing ideology of popular music—namely, the connection between music and the military. Advances in electronic communication had always developed according to their military applications. It was no different in the sixties and seventies. The connection became apparent to the Rolling Stones when they discovered that their label had channeled profits from their records into precisely this kind of research and development. Said Keith Richard: "We found out . . . that all the bread we made for Decca was going into making little black boxes that go into American Air Force bombers to bomb fucking North Vietnam. . . . That was it. Goddamn, you find you've helped to kill God knows how many thousands of people without even knowing it. I'd rather the Mafia than Decca."[^32]

While popular music maintained a strong connection to the women's movement and the antinuclear movement throughout the 1970s, it was a time when the idealism of the sixties began to fade. Adding to the loss of innocence, it was here that the popular David and Goliath tale of small independent labels successfully challenging the majors for market share ended. While the indies may still have entered the business to fill a void in the market, their larger function became providing research and development for the majors. When Robert Stigwood's RSO label and Neil Bogart's Casablanca demonstrated from the bottom up that a fortune could be made in disco, PolyGram simply stepped in and acquired a controlling interest in both labels. Warner engineered a similar acquisition when Seymour Stein's Sire demonstrated the commercial potential of new wave. Far from being in competition with the majors, the independents had now become part of the same corporate web.

# Rock and Its Effects on National Cultures

As early as 1969, with only eleven countries providing data, IFPI reported that the revenues from the international sale of recorded music had surpassed  $2 billion. By 1978 the figure had jumped to more than $10 billion, with twenty-two countries reporting.[^33] The fact that three of the five international firms that shared more than 70 percent of this windfall—through subsidiaries, licensing, and/or distribution—were U.S.-owned (and a fourth, British) was cause for concern among many smaller nations around the world, who feared that their national cultures might be overrun.

Earlier in the century, Great Britain itself had experienced the problem. In 1949 Tin Pan Alley had made such an impact on Britain that only 19 percent of the music on the BBC was British. By 1958, at the height of early rock and roll, that figure had declined to 14.8 percent.[^34] In the rock explosion of the fifties and sixties, British and U.S. popular music were exported to every corner of the globe. As early as 1977 both CBS and RCA were reporting that more than 50 percent of their sales came from their international divisions.[^35] Even in developing countries, the British and U.S. popularity charts provided guidance for local licensees and radio stations regarding which international selections were worth releasing locally.

In this connection, Wallis and Malm noted that the 1970s were characterized by "the almost simultaneous emergence of what could be termed 'national pop and rock music'" in countries throughout the world.[^36] This included the adoption of electric instruments and related sound-amplification equipment. In this context, a general debate about culture dating from the sixties turned toward the question of cultural imperialism, particularly on the part of the United States, and to some extent Great Britain, as many nations became more involved in popular music. In Puerto Rico, for example, the rivalry between salseros and rockeros became so intense that it was often discussed as a referendum on national identity. Socialist countries, with a few notable exceptions such as the German Democratic Republic, tended toward the active suppression of Western popular music and rock-related styles in particular. In these instances rock was perceived as "the music of the enemy," consistent with the cultural imperialism thesis.

A closer look at the roots of rock, however, revealed a more complicated picture. Among its defining characteristics, European melodic and harmonic elements rested on a foundation of Africanisms—rhythm as an organizing principle, bent notes, syncopated phrasing, the call-and-response style—as well as a host of other influences as diverse as Latin American, French Creole, and Hawaiian.[^37] "It is difficult to argue, therefore," as Andrew Goodwin and Joe Gore pointed out, "that rock music is 'Western' in quite the same way that Hollywood cinema or British television news are."[^38] From this perspective, it would probably be more accurate to describe the emergence of popular West African genres such as Nigerian Afrobeat and Ghanaian Afro-rock as the culture of the African diaspora returning home, rather than a clear-cut instance of cultural imperialism.

Until this time, most governments and national elites tended to steer clear of the popular music sector, considering it to be a commercial product with little or no cultural value. If there were government policies at all, they were usually directed at preserving traditional musics or developing a national art music, which was usually a colonial vestige of European classical music. The developments of the 1970s caused many nations to reevaluate their policies toward popular music. Among the countries visited by Wallis and Malm, "Sweden and Denmark started to give grants to music groups playing national pop and rock. In Tunisia popular Arabic film music was introduced into government supported festivals as was calypso music in Trinidad, reggae music in Jamaica, Welsh-language rock music in Wales and, prior to 1973, neue cancion chilena in Chile. . . . A national pop and rock group, the Afro 70 group, with new electric and electronic instruments, represented Tanzania at FESTAC 77."[^39]

Unquestionably, the introduction of Western culture, technology, and organizational forms can exert a transformative influence on traditional cultures. The adoption of electric instruments and amplification can place financial strain on musicians. The establishment of a star system and the introduction of format radio can limit possibilities for exposure. Musics that have developed primarily in live performance and that serve ritual social functions can be packaged and sold to the world as entertainment.[^40] The issue, however, is whether or not such changes negate the use value of music. Roots reggae—a product of U.S. rhythm and blues, commercialization, Western technology, and Jamaicanento rhythms—can hardly be described as a music that has been stripped of its cultural power and political edge.

Technology is invariably a double-edged sword. In addition to adding to the coffers of multinational record companies, recording technology also provides small countries with a means of reproducing their own music. Cassette tape is a case in point. It was introduced by Philips in 1963, and later improvements provided the transnational music industry with an efficient format for expansion into remote areas. Cassettes became the preferred configuration for music reception internationally in the mid-eighties. However, precisely because the technology is portable and recordable, it has also been used in the production, duplication, and dissemination of local musics and in the creation of new musical styles. In this way the technology has tended to decentralize control over the production and consumption of music. Decentralized control holds out the possibility that new voices and new musics will find new avenues for expression.

It is important in this regard to consider the social relations of popular music, as distinct from those of other mass media. Most mass cultural products, such as film or video, are generally produced and manufactured in one country and sold as finished products in another. Popular music, on the other hand, is most often exported as a master tape, which is then manufactured locally.[^41] This encourages the development of a whole production and distribution infrastructure within the host country. In order to make their facilities cost-effective, multinational recording companies typically get involved in the production of local musics. The employees of the subsidiaries of multinational recording companies are most likely to be residents of the host country. The availability of production facilities, in turn, encourages the development of ancillary small businesses such as clubs and retail outlets, often owned and operated by local residents. With local mentors to turn to, indigenous artists become more aware of their rights and the value of their cultural products.

On a deeper, cultural level, and particularly in those countries with strong musical traditions of their own, there is an interaction between international pop and indigenous musics which simply doesn't exist with other mass cultural forms. "[T]he world had been flooded with Anglo-American music in the fifties and sixties," asserted Wallis and Malm. "This influenced but did not prevent local musicians from developing their own styles, adapted to their own cultures."[^42] While the connection between these musics and various rock styles is often obvious, each is also linked—by some combination of language, concrete references, instrumentation, and performance styles—to an indigenous culture. The results, at least as regards music, usually approximate what Wallis and Malm call "transculturation"—a two-way process whereby elements of international pop, rock, and rhythm and blues are incorporated into local and national musical cultures, and indigenous influences contribute to the development of new transnational styles.[^43]

In the early 1980s, the potential of this process might have been pushed to a new level, as advances in satellite transmission, which became apparent in the United States with the launching of MTV in 1981, created the possibility of instant national exposure for recording artists and the simultaneous broadcast of performances on a worldwide scale. On the international stage, the wonders of satellite transmission manifested themselves most dramatically in the phenomenon of mega-events—a series of socially conscious international concerts and all-star performances dubbed "charity rock"—that began in 1985 with Live Aid. Given its humanitarian impulse, charity rock provided a moment of opportunity, albeit a limited one, where internationalization itself was a two-way process. While British and American music was disproportionately broadcast to a worldwide audience, the international sounds of artists like Youssou N'Dour and Sly and Robbie also gained greater access to the world market.

The greater acceptance of artists from developing countries prompted the creation of new international marketing structures and promotional vehicles, as non-Western popular musics were incorporated into umbrella categories such as world music or world beat, for sale in industrialized nations. The transnational music industry could have taken this development as a glimpse into a more decentralized and culturally diverse future. But embracing such a vision would have required the industry to challenge some of its own restrictive patterns, such as privileging the English language as a precondition for success in the largest international markets. Instead, the major labels retreated into a formula mentality that pointed the way to a more limiting international culture.

# Globalization: Blockbusters, Superstars, and Revenue Streams

Like all capitalist enterprises, the transnational music industry tends toward expansion and concentration. But try as they might to manipulate the market, history has proven that it is seldom one they can predict or control. The triumph of rock and roll in the 1950s is a case in point. And while a handful of major corporations may rule financially, it is important to note that this is not synonymous with controlling the form, content, and style of popular music. The overwhelming success of hip-hop in the face of exclusion, suppression, and outright censorship is testament enough to that. If anything, record companies have relinquished control over form and content in their relentless pursuit of higher profits.

Beginning in the 1980s, the major companies embarked on a strategy that made production significantly more restrictive, making it harder for new artists to enter the business. The precipitating incident was a recession that hit the industry in the early 1980s. From an all-time high of $11.4 billion in 1980, the sales figures from IFPI's two dozen or so reporting countries declined some 18 percent to $9.4 billion in 1983. While recovery began in 1984, the industry as a whole did not fully return to its 1980 level until 1986.[^44] In an industry thought to be recession-proof, this was a seismic event; labels responded by laying off personnel, trimming artist rosters, and limiting the number of new releases. Between 1980 and 1986 CBS alone eliminated over 7,000 positions worldwide.[^45]

The runaway success of Michael Jackson's *Thriller* pointed the way to recovery. Released in 1983, *Thriller* went on to sell some 40 million units worldwide, generating an unprecedented seven Top Ten singles and a record twelve Grammy Awards in the process. For the major companies, this became the model for success. In the cost-cutting fever generated by the recession, major companies looked to reap greater rewards from fewer artists. If a single artist can move 40 million units, they reasoned, why shoulder the extra administrative, production, and marketing costs of 80 artists moving half a million units each? *Thriller* thus signaled an era of blockbuster LPs featuring a limited number of superstar artists as the solution to the industry's economic woes.

Over the next few years a significant proportion of music industry revenues were generated by a few dozen superstar artists; in addition to Michael Jackson, there were Lionel Richie, Madonna, Prince, Bruce Springsteen, Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, Wham!, Phil Collins, Steve Winwood, Huey Lewis and the News, the Pointer Sisters, Janet Jackson, Anita Baker, and a handful of others. A surprising number of the new superstars were black. This was perhaps the first hint that the greater cosmopolitanism of a world market might produce some changes in the complexion of popular music.

But if it looked like the industry had at least succeeded in becoming more inclusive of African Americans and women, one couldn't help but notice that the only artists outside the British-American axis of popular music who could rival these superstars in terms of sales and cultural impact—Bob Marley, U2, Abba—all sang in English. Even Julio Iglesias, at one point the best-selling artist in the world, had to sing in English to generate hits in the United States. This lesson was hardly wasted on Francophone artist Celine Dion, who made her bid for international stardom on the strength of her first all-English LP, Unison, and subsequently cemented her position with the cross-media blockbuster, Titanic.

It was at this point that the transnational music companies began to think of themselves more as exploiters of rights than producers of records. Their new mission was to develop as many "revenue streams" as possible. Music-television and cross-media marketing—particularly movie tie-ins—were crucial to this development. All of the above artists had music videos on MTV, many of which were also connected to first-run Hollywood films. The video promoted the movie. The movie sold the record. The label cashed in at every step. Advertising was also institutionalized as a source of revenue; the Beatles' "Revolution" sold sneakers just as Dylan's "The Times They Are A'Changin'" made an accounting firm that much hipper. The music industry had effectively harnessed all the technology and marketing tools at its disposal to create an international roster of superstars who were capable of generating unheard-of profits with less product.

As usual, technology—in this case the compact disc—played a key role in the industry's success story. The CD was introduced in the early 1980s simultaneously by Philips and Sony. In terms of sound quality, resistance to wear, and ease of use, the CD was far superior to the LP. While market penetration was slow at first, because of the added expenditure for new hardware, by 1988 worldwide unit sales of LPs and CDs were roughly on par. Because CDs were priced significantly higher than LPs (even though they cost no more to manufacture), purchases in the new configuration added millions to a label's bottom line. In 1986 "the sale of 53 million CDs generated almost as much income ( $930 million) as the 125 million LPs sold ( $983 million)."[^46] By the end of the decade, the LP had begun its descent into virtual extinction.

The introduction of the CD opened up yet another revenue stream for the major labels—back catalogue. Back catalogue had always been a valuable commodity, as hit records have often boosted sales on previous recordings as well. With the advent of compact discs in the mid-eighties, back catalogue took on an even greater significance as consumers began buying recordings they already owned in the new configuration. The success of reissued artist retrospectives as boxed sets rendered back catalogue even more valuable. By the early nineties, catalogue sales were estimated as high as 40 percent of all album sales, making back catalogue, for many top-selling artists, their most valuable asset.

As always, however, the technology cut both ways. The CD may have captured the market in terms of quality, but cassette tape, because of its greater versatility as a recordable medium, remained the preferred configuration, still outselling CDs two to one until the end of the decade. Cassette technology may have enabled the transnational music industry to penetrate remote corners of the globe, but it was also responsible for the industry's two main financial headaches of the 1980s—piracy and home taping.

In 1982 IFPI estimated piracy at 11 percent of the total market in the United States and Canada, 21 percent in Latin America, 30 percent in Africa, and 66 percent in Asia.[^47] The organization had begun to deal with the threat as early as 1971, when they convened the Phonograms Convention, which proposed a three-stage strategy to curb piracy. Stages I and II, which dealt with protecting the major and minor markets, respectively, had made significant progress by the early 1980s. For Stage III, aimed at pirates "mainly ... situated in the developing world," the genteel system of international conventions was put aside in favor of a more bare-knuckles approach, tying piracy to trade sanctions against the offending nation. By treating music as an "export industry," the more powerful record-producing nations used their economic and political weight to reign in piratical practices elsewhere.[^48] This strategy, it should be noted, presupposes an uneven flow of capital and cultural goods, in that developing countries would likely have neither a positive balance of trade in intellectual property nor the economic clout to resist the pressure of industrialized nations. As a result of this approach, musical copyright issues have increasingly been built into trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), the EC's Single European Market program, and the international General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

As regards home taping, IFPI argued that the decline in industry revenues during the recession was directly related to the rising sales of cassette tape recorders and blank tape. There was little hard evidence to support the claim. Nevertheless, IFPI initiated an international campaign to levy a tax on blank tape and equipment that could be used to compensate copyright holders for their loss of income. The industry was not monolithic on this issue. The economic self-interest of hardware manufacturers like Philips, Sony, and Matsushita, who were in the process of bringing digital audio tape (DAT) recorders to market, was quite at odds with that of record companies, who saw blank tape levies as another potential revenue stream. This tension sometimes played itself out among different divisions of the same firm (e.g., Sony, which bought CBS Records in 1988). The hardware manufacturers and record companies finally came to terms in the IFPIbrokered Athens Agreement of 1989. The resulting "memorandum of understanding" provided a blueprint for legislation like the U.S. Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, which imposes levies on digital audio-recording devices and media. The legislation mandates that record companies get 38 percent of the royalty pool, performers 26 percent, and writers and publishers 17 percent each, with the remainder divided among unfeatured musicians and vocalists.[^49]

While such legislation appears, at first glance, to confer some measure of recognition on performers (a first in the United States), it is limited in a number of respects. In the first place, only digital hardware and recordable media (i.e., DAT) were subject to the royalty initially. And since the Athens Agreement mandated that all digital recording devices would be equipped with Philips' digital Serial Copy Management System (SCMS), which permits only one digital copy of a digital recording, DAT never caught on as a consumer medium in Europe or the United States. Since the U.S. legislation also included provision for Congress to amend the law as needed to accommodate new technologies, however, it may yet become a significant source of industry revenue, as new configurations like recordable CDs (CD-R and CD-RW) take hold.

Although the rhetoric surrounding intellectual property and the logic of copyright often appears to support the struggling artist, in practice, the result is a very imprecise and uneven system. In the industrialized world, most copyright distribution formulas favor older, more established artists. In 1982, for example, a mere 12 percent of the PRS's 12,000 members shared 80 percent of the Society's earnings.[^50] In developing countries, the question of collecting royalties across national boundaries at all presents major problems and internal distribution to artists and writers is even more haphazard.

For all its complaining about lost revenues, the major music corporations quickly resumed a pattern of steady growth following the recession of the early eighties. By 1993 the IFPI family of nations reported $30 billion in worldwide sales. Given the reconfigurations of the global economy, however, full recovery did not come about without some profound structural changes in the ownership patterns of the transnational music industry. Record companies were being bought and sold in a speculative atmosphere that made the merger mania of the late 1960s pale by comparison. In 1988 MCA bought Motown for $60 million. A couple of years later PolyGram purchased A&M and Island for upwards of $300 million each. Then MCA shelled out $545 million for Geffen Records.

These huge recording combines were, in turn, bought out by larger multinational corporations. EMI Records remained a division of Thorn EMI (created in 1979), which also controlled Capitol, Virgin, Chrysalis, IRS, and Rhino, among others. The German publishing conglomerate Bertelsmann purchased RCA Records and its affiliated labels when the record division was dumped in the General Electric takeover of RCA. When Sony bought CBS Records (renamed Sony Music) in 1988 for $2 billion, it was the biggest record-company sale in the history of the industry. Those numbers were dwarfed in 1990 when Matsushita forked over $6.6 billion for MCA and its affiliated labels, only to resell the combined companies to Seagrams of Canada five years later. When all was said and done, only one of the Big Five transnational record companies—WEA (Warner/Elektra/Atlantic), a division of Time-Warner—remained in U.S. hands, and in 1991

Time-Warner entered a partnership agreement with Toshiba and C. Itoh to the tune of one billion U.S. dollars.

These new configurations clearly had implications for cultural representation. When Michael Jackson recorded *Thriller* in 1983, Epic Records was U.S.-owned. By the time *Dangerous* was released, the label had become a division of Japanese-owned Sony-CBS, which constructed not so much a supranational cultural identity as a global manufacturing and distribution network, ready to mass market anything that will sell internationally. Queried Simon Frith: "whose culture do Sony-CBS and BMG-RCA represent?"[^51]

Even though the world may have been poised to accept a rather broad range of musics pointing toward a more decentralized plan for artist development, the music industry did not alter its marketing strategies in the least. "Instead of investing in and nurturing a wide range of new talents," observed Anthony DeCurtis in 1992, "record companies are betting wildly like drunks at the roulette table, hoping that one big score—whether by an old favorite or a new lucky number—will cover all past debts."[^52] Ever since Thriller, the music industry has been stuck in a notion of artist development that demands superstardom. Consequently, record companies spent the early nineties ponying up millions for contracts that were as unprecedented as they were unrecoverable.

When Janet Jackson switched from A&M to Virgin in 1991, with only two albums (albeit both number 1) to her credit, she scored a reported S30-million deal. Virgin chairman Richard Branson compared the signing to buying a Rembrandt. Columbia's Don Jenner described Mariah Carey's platinum debut more crassly. "We don't look at Mariah Carey as a dance-pop artist," said Jenner. "We look at her as a franchise."[^53] Aerosmith inked a new deal with Columbia in 1991 worth upwards of  $30 million. That same year, Motley Crue reupped with Elektra for a $25-million guarantee. ZZ Top scored $30 million at RCA. The Rolling Stones topped them with a $40-million, three-album deal at Virgin. And even these contracts couldn't compete with the deals offered to Madonna, Michael Jackson, and Prince (by then known simply as The Artist), each of which were reportedly worth more than $60 million in guarantees.

Interestingly, the biggest superstars failed to sell like superstars. Pearl Jam outsold Michael Jackson. New releases by Madonna and The Artist rose and fell on the charts as never before. The Artist sustained himself with three greatest-hits packages; Madonna with a fifty-dollar "art" book of revealing photographs of herself called Sex. But instead of learning from these lessons, in 1996 Warner signed R.E.M. to a five-album, $80-million deal, the largest contract in record-company history.

# Into the New Millennium

On the eve of the new millennium, corporate shuffling continued unabated. The unexpected demerger of Thorn EMI set the music division afloat, creating a prime target for acquisition. In 1998 Seagrams combined the holdings of MCA (acquired from Matsushita in 1995) and PolyGram (purchased for $10.4 billion) into a single corporate entity called, modestly enough, the Universal Music Group. Among the labels that UMG controls are MCA, Universal (formerly PolyGram), Geffen, A&M, Motown, Island, Mercury, London, and Interscope. The new mega-firm operates in forty-eight countries and boasts a market share (extrapolating from combined 1997 figures of both corporations) of 23 percent. This kind of merger represents a significant level of concentration in the music industry. The downside, of course, is that as many as 20 percent of the company's 15,500 employees could be fired and literally hundreds of bands could be dropped from its artist roster.[^54] No matter. While waiting for the next Michael Jackson to come along, the company will be able to sustain itself on the exploitation of catalogue from its more than forty wholly owned publishing offices.

In this regard, it is interesting to note that corporate capital has expanded its hold over intellectual property rights in at least three critical areas: extending the term of copyright, narrowing the arena for fair use, and creating brand-new intellectual property rights. In the 1990s both the European Community and the United States extended the term of copyright to a point that effectively eliminates the public domain for music written in the twentieth century. In a sweeping revision designed to bring the United States in line with changes in the European Community dating back to 1993, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 extended U.S. copyrights owned by corporations to ninety-five years and individually held copyrights to the life of the author plus seventy years. While the move was spearheaded by Disney because, under the existing law, Mickey Mouse was about to enter the public domain, such legislation obviously serves the interests of transnational capital, which is becoming better organized on an administrative level.

One of the main avenues through which the international music industry currently seeks to protect its interests is the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), established in 1970 and currently representing 171 member nations. WIPO is charged with developing treaties for protecting the rights of intellectual property owners. These agreements are, in turn, codified in national legislation such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 in the United States, which makes it illegal to circumvent technological measures for protecting sound recordings and other copyrighted material. Seemingly in the interest of creative artists, such measures compel us to revisit the diminishing terrain of fair use. "If data can be protected by code—and it's illegal to break the code," argues Robert J. Samuelson, "then 'fair use' for anything that arrives digitally may vanish."[^55]

Extending the reach of corporations even further, the most recent WIPO treaty calls for the creation of a completely new intellectual property right to protect the owners of electronic databases. "The general objective of this right," according to the treaty, "is to protect the investment of time, money, and effort by the maker of a database, irrespective of whether the database is in itself innovative."[^56] Depending on how narrowly the treaty is implemented, it may not only be illegal to duplicate a record, it may also be illegal to quote its chart position without permission.

Ironically, it may be the double blade of the technology that makes all of this possible which cuts into corporate control once again. Just as cassettes issued a challenge to centralized control in the seventies and eighties, newer technologies such as the MPEG 1—Audio Layer 3 (MP3) software compression format provides near-CD-quality, downloadable audio over the Internet. MP3 dates back to a 1987 collaboration between Germany's Fraunhofer Institut Integrierte Schaltungen and Dieter Seitzer from the University of Erlangen, whose work yielded a compression/decompression algorithm, or codec, that could shrink sound files to about one-tenth their normal size without sacrificing quality. In 1992 MP3 was approved as a standard by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), founded by Leonardo Chariglioni in Italy. But it wasn't until modem and computer clock speeds permitted efficient downloads of MP3 files that the technology threatened to turn the music industry on its head. By the late nineties music enthusiasts—indeed, artists themselves—were converting audio CD files to MP3 and posting them on websites for easy, and most often unauthorized, download. Since that time the term "MP3" has become second only to the word "sex" as the most requested item on Internet search engines.

Technologies like MP3 are threatening to the music industry for a number of reasons. In the first place, MP3 holds out the possibility of a business model that links artists directly with consumers, bypassing the record companies completely. And with articulate industry critics like Chuck D and forward-looking artists like Sheryl Crow already on board, MP3 is generating a momentum that the industry can ill afford to ignore. According to Wired magazine: "About 846 million new CDs were sold last year. But at least 17 million MP3 files are downloaded from the Net each day. That adds up to almost 3 billion in the first six months of 1999."[^57] As a result electronic distribution sites like MP3.com and online record labels like Atomic Pop, new home to such artists as Public Enemy and Ice-T, are challenging the status quo.

More upsetting from the industry point of view is the fact that MP3 is an unprotected format, which leaves the industry with no way to regulate its use. Desktop MP3 players such as MacAMP and Winamp (since purchased by America OnLine) have proliferated, enabling users to download and listen to MP3 files on their computers. They have become so successful that MP3 has attracted mainstream computer-industry giants like Microsoft and RealNetworks, who introduced the Windows Media Player and the RealJukebox, respectively, the latter of which was downloaded one million times within ten days of its launch.

It was the introduction of Diamond Multimedia's Rio, a portable MP3 player that moved MP3 beyond the computer desktop, which really caused the industry to stand up and take notice. The Rio is a walkman-like digital player, with no SCMS copy-protection chip, capable of downloading, storing, and playing back 60 minutes of MP3 music. Fearing piracy on a grand scale, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) was quick to bring suit, claiming a violation of the Audio Home Recording Act. Diamond, however, squeezed through a loophole by successfully arguing that the legislation targeted only recording devices and the Rio was a storage device. With the injunction quashed, other portable MP3 players were rushed to market, including Creative Labs' Nomad, Pontis' MPlayer3, and Empeg's Empeg Car, which can hold up to 5,000 songs.

Taking a more proactive stance, the international music industry, as represented by the RIAA, the Recording Industry Association of Japan, IFPI, and the Big Five recording companies, proposed the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI), an open standard that would encode a sound file with a digital "watermark" identifying its owner and origin, as a way of discouraging piracy on the Internet. Interestingly, the person the industry tapped to head up the SDMI project was none other than Leonardo Chariglioni, the founder of MPEG, who certified MP3 in the first place.

With well over 100 organizations participating, SDMI required an enormous amount of collaboration. At the same time, record companies were feeling the pressure to have a commercially viable online presence by the 1999 holiday season, whether it was standardized or not. As a result, individual record companies began making independent deals to advance their own online interests. Universal Music Group and Bertelsman launched GetMusic.com using the Liquid Audio Player for downloading. Free-floating EMI also chose to work with Liquid Audio for secure downloads. Sony formed an alliance with Microsoft using their Media Player software and, together with Warner, merged their jointly owned Columbia House Record Club with the online retail outlet CD Now.

As of this writing, the industry is far from implementing standardized security protocols that work, and new technologies like MP3 show no signs of abatement. While transnational music corporations scramble to protect their bottom lines on new fronts, artists and fans may, at least momentarily, gain some measure of direct access to each other and to sound reproduction possibilities that are becoming increasingly harder to control.

From 1942 to 1944, eight million V-discs, representing some 400 recordings of more than 640 artists, were distributed. Donating their time and music for free, artists from rival record labels, who might otherwise have been prohibited from recording together for contractual reasons, created a number of "once-in-a-l lifetime" sessions for the V-disc program. V-discs were particularly valuable in that they were the only recordings that were permitted during the AFM strike of 1942. To discourage personal gain from this enterprise, most of the V-discs were recalled and destroyed after the war.
