Like any culture industry in a market economy, the role of the music business is fundamentally to transform its cultural products into financial rewards. This process, of course, has been significantly influenced by the technological advances that have determined the production, dissemination, and reception of music. To understand the trajectory of popular music in the twentieth century from its beginnings as a nation-based, mass cultural phenomenon to its current state as part of a global system of interactive, transnational cultural flows, one must trace the uneven relationship between cultural development, technological advancement, professional organization, political struggle, and economic power. Since technological advances and the economic power that drives them have been historically centered in industrialized nations (primarily Great Britain, Western Europe, and the United States), these countries have tended to provide the models for the relationship between popular music and the industry that produces it. Given that two world wars were fought on European soil, with devastating material consequences, at key points in the development of the mass media, the industrialization of popular music has been defined disproportionately by the dominant and often controversial practices of the United States. It is also the case that the pivotal musical moment of the twentieth century in terms of cultural redefinition and structural change in music industry—the eruption of rock and roll—was centered in the United States in the 1950s, and expanded to Great Britain in the 1960s. More recently, however, the relationship between corporate capital and musical culture has transcended national boundaries, as the music industry has become an increasingly global phenomenon.

> 与市场经济中的任何文化产业一样，音乐产业的作用从根本上说就是将其文化产品转化为经济回报。当然，这一过程受到技术进步的显著影响，这些技术进步决定了音乐的制作、传播和接收。要理解 20 世纪流行音乐的轨迹，从其作为一种基于民族的大众文化现象的开端，到其作为互动性跨国文化流动的全球系统的一部分的当前状态，人们必须追溯文化发展、技术进步、专业组织、政治斗争和经济力量之间不平衡的关系。由于技术进步和驱动它们的经济力量在历史上一直集中在工业化国家（主要是英国、西欧和美国），这些国家倾向于为流行音乐与生产它的产业之间的关系提供模式。鉴于两次世界大战都在欧洲土地上进行，在大众媒体发展的关键时期造成了毁灭性的物质后果，流行音乐的工业化在很大程度上受到美国占主导地位且常常备受争议的做法的影响。同样，20 世纪在文化再定义和音乐产业结构变革方面的关键音乐时刻——摇滚乐的爆发——集中于 20 世纪 50 年代的美国，并于 20 世纪 60 年代扩展到英国。然而，最近，随着音乐产业日益成为一种全球现象，企业资本与音乐文化之间的关系已经超越了国界。


In broad strokes, the history of the music industry can be seen in three phases, each dominated by a different kind of organization:

1. Music publishing houses, which occupied the power center of the industry when sheet music was the primary vehicle for disseminating popular music;  
2. Record companies, which ascended to power as recorded music achieved dominance; and  
3. Transnational entertainment corporations, which promote music as an ever-expanding series of "revenue streams"—record sales, advertising revenue, movie tie-ins, streaming audio on the Internet—no longer tied to a particular sound carrier.

> 概括来说，音乐产业的历史可分为三个阶段，每个阶段都由不同类型的组织主导：
>
> 1. 音乐出版公司，当乐谱是传播流行音乐的主要载体时，它们占据了产业的权力中心；
> 2. 唱片公司，随着录制音乐占据主导地位，它们崛起并掌握了权力；
> 3. 跨国娱乐公司，它们将音乐推广为一系列不断扩大的“收入来源”——唱片销售、广告收入、电影搭售、互联网上的流媒体音频——不再与特定的声音载体绑定。


Because the centrality of record companies has predominated in the second half of the twentieth century, this phase of development remains the popular conception of the music industry, even though its structure has shifted markedly in recent years. Consequently, the prevailing view of the popular music industry is that of record companies at the center, with radio, music videos, live concerts, booking agencies, management firms, indeed musicians themselves, playing various supporting roles. Because some of the major changes in popular music in the twentieth century can be traced to the technological developments that enabled record companies to displace publishing houses as the power center of the music business, the tendency is to use the terms "music industry" and "recording industry" synonymously. Initially, however, they were quite separate and there was little contact between the two.

> 由于唱片公司在 20 世纪下半叶占据了主导地位的中心位置，这一发展阶段至今仍是大众对音乐产业的普遍认知，尽管近年来其结构已发生显著变化。因此，流行音乐产业的主流观点仍将唱片公司置于核心地位，而电台、音乐视频、现场音乐会、预订机构、管理公司乃至音乐家本人都扮演着各种辅助角色。由于 20 世纪流行音乐的某些重大变革可追溯至技术发展——这些发展使唱片公司得以取代出版社成为音乐产业的权力中心——人们往往将“音乐产业”与“录音产业”这两个术语等同使用。然而最初，它们是完全分离的领域，彼此之间几乎毫无联系。

Throughout the early development of sound recording, sheet music was the main vehicle for the mass dissemination of music and music publishers were at the center of the music business. At this time, the centerpiece of middle-class home entertainment was the piano. From the turn of the twentieth century until the end of World War I, the number of pianos and player pianos manufactured in the United States alone averaged about 300,000 annually[^1]. Recording started as a sideline business, initially given to spoken word comedy, instrumental brass-band releases, and other novelty selections. It is not surprising, then, that the publishers initially regarded the revolution in technology that would eventually transform the production and consumption of popular music as little more than a supplement to their earnings from sheet music. They were too busy enjoying the fruits of a very lucrative, centuries-old relationship with this earlier form of music software.

> 在录音技术的早期发展阶段，乐谱是音乐大规模传播的主要载体，音乐出版商则处于音乐产业的核心位置。当时，钢琴是中产阶级家庭娱乐的中心设备。从 20 世纪初到第一次世界大战结束，仅美国制造的钢琴和自动钢琴数量年均就达到约 300,000 架[^1]。录音起初只是一项副业，最早以口语喜剧、铜管乐队器乐唱片及其他新奇选段为主。因此，出版商最初将这场最终彻底改变流行音乐制作与消费的技术革命，仅仅视为乐谱收入的补充，也就不足为奇了。他们正忙于享受与这种音乐软件的早期形式之间长达数世纪、利润丰厚的合作成果。

## Music Publishing: The Origins of an Industry
**音乐出版：一个行业的起源**

When Johann Gutenberg invented movable type around 1450, he laid the foundation for the modern music-publishing industry. After his hometown of Mainz was sacked by invading armies shortly after the introduction of his invention, the fledgling printing industry was dispersed, first to France and Italy, and then to England. This was a period of significant social upheaval, involving the establishment of merchant cities throughout Europe, the concomitant expansion of a new middle class, and a growing secularization of church-based cultures. In this process, according to Russell Sanjek, "[c]ontrol of the duplicating process had moved from the hands of the church into those of the entrepreneur. Literature was becoming secularized to meet the demands of its new audience, and music, too, would soon be laicized as its principal patron, the church, was replaced by the public consumer."[^2] Operating under an exclusive contract with the city of Venice, [[Ottaviano dei Petrucci]] prepared his first publication, a collection of 96 popular songs (mostly French chansons), which qualified him for the title, the Father of Music Publishing.[^3]

> 大约在 1450 年，当 Johann Gutenberg 发明活字印刷术时，他为现代音乐出版业奠定了基础。在他的发明推出后不久，他的家乡美因茨被入侵军队洗劫，新兴的印刷业分散了，首先传到法国和意大利，然后传到英格兰。这是一个重大社会动荡的时期，涉及整个欧洲商人城市的建立、新中产阶级的伴随扩张，以及以教会为基础的文化的日益世俗化。在这个过程中，根据 Russell Sanjek 的说法，“复制过程的控制权已从教会手中转移到企业家手中。文学正变得世俗化以满足新观众的需求，音乐也很快将被世俗化，因为其主要赞助者教会被公众消费者所取代。”[^2]在与威尼斯市签订独家合同的情况下，Ottaviano dei Petrucci 准备了他的第一份出版物，一本包含 96 首流行歌曲（ mostly French chansons ）的合集，这使他获得了音乐出版之父的称号。[^3]

In the new mercantile economy, the dependency of feudal relations and the elitism of the patronage system were gradually replaced by the relative democracy of the marketplace. As sites of manufacturing and central distribution points for merchant ships and caravans from distant lands, medieval cities served as host for diverse cultures. Slowly a pan-European body of literary and musical works appeared. As the financial interests of merchant bookseller-publishers expanded, they began to join forces to lobby for legal protection.

> 在新的商业经济体系中，封建关系的依附性与赞助制度的精英主义逐渐被市场经济的相对民主所取代。作为制造业基地以及远洋商船与商队的中枢分销节点，中世纪城市成为多元文化的交汇点。泛欧洲范围的文学与音乐作品体系逐渐形成。随着书商兼出版商财务利益的扩展，他们开始联合力量游说以寻求法律保护。

The first copyright law was enacted in Britain in 1710, when Parliament passed the Statute of Anne, the basis for legal protection of intellectual property in the English-speaking world. While the law included an author's copyright and protections for consumers (by limiting the term of copyright and creating a "public domain"), it clearly favored the stationer's guild, which enjoyed royal sanctions granting an effective monopoly on publishing in return for cooperation in ferreting out and suppressing seditious literary or musical material. In this reciprocal arrangement, booksellers fared considerably better than authors or composers. It wasn't until the end of the eighteenth century, according to Finkelstein, "that composers were able to actually make an important part of their living from the printing and sale of their music."[^4] This coincided with the growth of a domestic market for pianos and the establishment of the instrument as a cultural status symbol throughout Europe.

> 第一部版权法于 1710 年 在英国颁布，当时议会通过了安妮法案，这是英语世界知识产权法律保护的基础。虽然该法律包括了作者的版权和对消费者的保护（通过限制版权期限和创建“公共领域”），但它明显偏袒了书商公会，该公会享有皇家制裁，授予有效的出版垄断权，以换取合作追查和镇压煽动性的文学或音乐材料。在这种互惠安排中，书商比作者或作曲家过得要好得多。直到十八世纪末，根据 Finkelstein，“作曲家们才真正能够通过印刷和销售他们的音乐来谋生的重要部分。”[^4]这与钢琴国内市场的增长以及该乐器在整个欧洲作为文化地位象征的确立相吻合。

By the nineteenth century, music-publishing interests had begun to turn their attention toward international copyright systems because, as Dave Laing has pointed out, "music, more than other arts, easily crossed national linguistic and cultural boundaries."[^5] Britain enacted its first International Copyright Act in 1838 and extended its provisions to include music in 1842. In the latter half of the nineteenth century there ensued a number of multilateral meetings across the continent among members of the music trade which culminated in the Berne Convention of 1886. Berne was essentially a treaty that provided for reciprocal recognition of copyright among sovereign nations. Seven of the initial nine signatories to the Berne Convention were European. Since 1886 the convention has been amended six times essentially to keep pace with the emergence of new technologies: Berlin (1908) incorporated photography, film, and sound recording; Rome (1928) added broadcasting; Brussels (1948), television. By 1993 there were almost 100 signatories to the Berne Convention.[^6] Significantly, the United States did not sign on until 1988, more than 100 years after the founding convention.

> 到 19 世纪，音乐出版业开始将注意力转向国际版权体系，正如 Dave Laing 所指出的，“与其他艺术形式相比，音乐更容易跨越国家的语言和文化边界。”[^5]英国于 1838 年颁布了第一部《国际版权法》，并于 1842 年将其条款扩展至涵盖音乐作品。19 世纪后半叶，欧洲大陆的音乐行业代表举行了一系列多边会议，最终促成了 1886 年的《伯尔尼公约》。《伯尔尼公约》本质上是一项旨在主权国家间相互承认版权的条约。该公约最初的 9 个签署国中有 7 个是欧洲国家。自 1886 年以来，该公约已历经六次修订，主要是为了跟上新技术发展的步伐：1908 年的柏林修订纳入了摄影、电影和录音；1928 年的罗马修订增加了广播权；1948 年的布鲁塞尔修订则涵盖了电视。到 1993 年，《伯尔尼公约》已有近 100 个签署国。[^6]值得注意的是，美国直到 1988 年才加入该公约，这距离公约创立已过去了 100 多年。

At the time of Berne, U.S. popular music was only just beginning to come into its own, primarily through blackface minstrelsy and the works of Stephen Foster, which became popular throughout Europe. In the balance of trade, the United States would still have been showing a net loss on the import/export ratio of cultural products; it was not yet in the interest of the United States to embrace reciprocal arrangements with foreign publishers. Within a short time, however, U.S. music publishers would consolidate their operations into the most efficient music machine the world had yet seen—Tin Pan Alley.

> 在伯尔尼公约时期，美国流行音乐才刚刚开始崭露头角，主要是通过黑脸杂耍和 Stephen Foster 的作品，这些在欧洲变得流行。在贸易平衡中，美国在文化产品的进出口比率上仍然显示出净亏损；当时美国还没有利益去接受与外国出版商的互惠安排。然而，在短时间内，美国音乐出版商会将他们的业务整合成世界上最有效的音乐机器——Tin Pan Alley。

At a time when European art music was considered to be superior to popular selections, U.S. music publishers derived their income from the manufacture and sale of classical scores, many of which were in the public domain, and, increasingly, through original popular compositions. In the United States, sheet music retailied for about thirty to forty cents a copy and, for the major publishers, sales in the hundreds of thousands of copies were not unheard of. Charles K. Harris's "After the Ball," written and published in 1892, "quickly reached sales of $25,000 a week," and, according to Charles Hamm, "sold more than 2,000,000 copies in only several years, eventually achieving a sale of some five million."[^7] During this period, the previously scattered conglomeration of U.S. publishing houses, who would dominate mainstream popular music until the Second World War, were beginning to converge on the area of New York City that came to be known as Tin Pan Alley, after the tinny output of its upright pianos. Tin Pan Alley anticipated many of the practices of the music business in later years—and therefore provides the clearest model for how business would be conducted.

> 在欧洲艺术音乐被认为优于流行选择的时代，美国音乐出版商从古典乐谱的制造和销售中获取收入，其中许多乐谱属于公共领域，并且越来越多地通过原创流行作品。在美国，乐谱零售价约为每份 30 到 40 美分，对于主要出版商来说，销售数十万份并不罕见。Charles K. Harris 的《After the Ball》，创作并出版于 1892 年，“每周销售额迅速达到 25,000 美元，”并且，据 Charles Hamm 所说，“在仅仅几年内售出超过 2,000,000 份，最终达到约 5,000,000 的销量。”[^7]在此期间，先前分散的美国出版公司集团（它们将主导主流流行音乐直到第二次世界大战），开始汇聚到 New York City 的一个区域，该区域后来被称为 Tin Pan Alley，因其立式钢琴的刺耳声音而得名。Tin Pan Alley 预示了后来音乐业务的许多做法——因此提供了最清晰的商业模式。

While it is noteworthy that in less than twenty years leading up to the turn of the century, Tin Pan Alley centralized control of an industry that had been spread throughout major cities across the United States, it is perhaps more important that Tin Pan Alley produced only popular songs. Unlike the older, more traditional music-publishing houses, which issued a broad range of material, the "song factories" of Tin Pan Alley promoted an overwhelmingly successful formulaic pop mentality that yielded "a much more homogeneous style than had ever before been the case in the history of song in America."[^8] If the songwriting style of Tin Pan Alley was distinctive, its success was due in equal measure to its aggressive marketing tactics. Tin Pan Alley publishers routinely visited popular venues, offering star performers everything from personal favors to songwriting credits to include a particular song in their acts. Such an investment could be returned many-fold in sheet-music sales.

> 值得注意的是，在世纪之交前的不到 20 年间，Tin Pan Alley 集中控制了一个原本遍布美国各大城市的产业，但或许更重要的是，Tin Pan Alley 只生产流行歌曲。与发行范围广泛的老牌传统音乐出版社不同，Tin Pan Alley 的“歌曲工厂”推崇一种极其成功的公式化流行音乐思维，这种思维催生了“美国歌曲史上从未有过的、风格更为同质化的作品”。[^8]如果说 Tin Pan Alley 的歌曲创作风格独具特色，那么其成功同样在很大程度上归功于其激进的营销策略。Tin Pan Alley 的出版商们经常造访热门演出场所，为明星表演者提供各种好处——从个人关照到歌曲创作署名权——以促使他们将自己的特定歌曲纳入演出曲目。这样的投资往往能通过乐谱销售获得数倍的回报。

As was the case with publishing enterprises elsewhere, at this stage in its development Tin Pan Alley turned its attention toward legal protection. While these publishers clearly saw sheet music as their stock-in-trade—and, as a result, never fully embraced records—they saw no reason why their income shouldn't be supplemented with revenues from record sales. Thus, at the end of the first decade of the twentieth century—when it was clear that records were becoming a force to be reckoned with—there ensued a widespread revision of existing copyright laws to accommodate the new medium. In 1909, following the Berlin revision to the Berne Convention, Victor Herbert and John Philip Sousa led the charge for a revision to the U.S. copyright laws which mandated a royalty of two cents for each cylinder, record, or piano roll manufactured, in addition to revenues already derived from live performances. Because the U.S. Copyright Act of 1909 used the language of "mechanical reproduction," these new fees came to be known as a "mechanicals." Comparable laws were passed in Britain in 1911 and elsewhere on the continent at around the same time.

> 正如其他地方的出版企业一样，在其发展的这个阶段，Tin Pan Alley 将注意力转向了法律保护。虽然这些出版商清楚地视乐谱为他们的主要商品——因此从未完全接纳唱片——但他们认为没有理由不通过唱片销售的收入来补充他们的收入。因此，在二十世纪第一个十年结束时——当唱片显然成为一股不可忽视的力量时——随之而来的是对现有版权法的广泛修订，以适应这种新媒介。1909 年，继柏林对《伯尔尼条约》的修订之后，Victor Herbert 和 John Philip Sousa 领导了对美国版权法的修订，该修订规定每制造一个圆筒、唱片或钢琴卷轴需支付两美分的版税，此外还有来自现场表演的收入。因为 1909 年的 U.S. Copyright Act 使用了“机械复制”的措辞，这些新费用被称为“机械复制费”。类似的法律于 1911 年在英国以及欧洲大陆其他地区大约同一时间通过。

To recover their sources of revenue more efficiently, publishers in the industrialized world, in alliance with composers and songwriters, began to organize themselves into professional associations known in the trade as performing rights organizations. France had anticipated this development, forming the Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique (SACEM) in 1850. Italy and Austria followed suit before the turn of the century. Three other industrialized music-producing nations came on board before World War I. Publishers in Great Britain formed the Performing Rights Society (PRS), and in Germany, Geselteschaft für Musikalische Aufführungs (GEMA). The Tin Pan Alley publishers established the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) in 1914. In 1926 these various national societies formed an international confederation, Confédération Internationale des Sociétés Auteurs et Compositeurs (CISAC), headquartered in France.

> 为了更有效地恢复其收入来源，工业化国家的出版商与作曲家和词曲作者结盟，开始组织起来，形成了业内称为表演权组织的专业协会。法国预见到了这一发展，于 1850 年成立了音乐作者、作曲家和出版商协会（SACEM）。意大利和奥地利在世纪之交前纷纷效仿。第一次世界大战前，另外三个工业化的音乐生产国也加入其中。英国的出版商成立了表演权协会（PRS），而在德国，则成立了音乐表演权协会（GEMA）。Tin Pan Alley 的出版商于 1914 年创立了美国作曲家、作家和出版商协会（ASCAP）。1926 年，这些不同的国家协会联合成立了一个国际联盟——国际作者和作曲家协会联合会（CISAC），总部设在法国。

In general, in their formative stages performing rights organizations were exclusive societies with national monopolies on copyrighted music. Membership in ASCAP, for example, was skewed toward the more "literate" writers of show tunes and semi-serious works such as Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, Cole Porter, George Gershwin, and Irving Berlin. Writers of more vernacular forms, such as the blues and country music, were excluded from ASCAP. As proprietors of the compositions of their members, these organizations exercised considerable power in shaping public taste.

> 总体而言，表演权组织在其形成阶段是具有国家垄断性的专属协会，掌控着受版权保护的音乐。例如，美国作曲家、作家与出版商协会（ASCAP）的会员资格明显偏向于创作更具“文学性”的秀场曲调及半严肃作品的作品家，例如 Richard Rodgers 与 Lorenz Hart、Cole Porter、George Gershwin 以及 Irving Berlin。而布鲁斯和乡村音乐等更具通俗风格的作品家则被排除在 ASCAP 之外。作为其会员作品的所有者，这些组织在塑造公众品味方面行使了相当大的权力。

Just as technological advances such as movable type favored industrialized nations, copyright laws kept artistic expression firmly anchored to the European cultural tradition of notated music, in that the claim for royalties was based on the registration of melodies and lyrics, the aspects of music that most readily lend themselves to notation. Artists or countries with musical traditions based on rhythm rather than melody or those that valued improvisation over notation were excluded from the full benefit of copyright protection right from the start. Further, as an extension of literary copyright, musical copyright was based on a conception of authorship, which tended to penalize societies in which composition was conceived as a collective activity.

> 正如活字印刷等技术进步曾惠及工业化国家一样，版权法将艺术表达牢牢锚定在欧洲记谱音乐的文化传统中——因为版税主张的基础正是旋律与歌词的登记注册，而这两者恰是音乐中最易于被记谱的要素。从一开始，那些基于节奏而非旋律的音乐传统，或重视即兴创作胜过记谱体系的艺术家与国家，便被排除在版权保护的完整受益范围之外。此外，作为文学版权的延伸，音乐版权建立在作者权观念之上，这种观念往往对将创作视为集体活动的社会形态产生不利影响。

# Recording Companies: The Commodification of Sound
**唱片公司：声音的商品化**

Although it was clear before the dawn of the twentieth century that the future of the recording industry would be tied to music and entertainment, this was not obvious at first. When Thomas Edison unveiled his legendary "talking machine" in 1877, which is generally considered the birth of recording, the reproduction of music was fourth down his list of intended uses. Edison, as well as most of his competitors, initially saw the phonograph, as he called it, as an office machine, with practical applications in stenography, books for the blind, and teaching elocation. How the fledgling industry gravitated toward music and what they chose to record speaks volumes about the role of the music industry in the production of music.

> 尽管在二十世纪黎明之前就已清晰可见，录音行业的未来将与音乐和娱乐紧密相连，但这在最初并不明显。当 Thomas Edison 于 1877 年揭晓其传奇的“会说话的机器”——这被普遍视为录音技术的诞生之时，音乐复制在其预期用途列表中仅位列第四。Edison 及其大多数竞争对手最初将这种他称之为 phonograph 的设备视为办公机器，着眼于其在速记、盲人书籍和演讲教学中的实际应用。这个新兴行业如何转向音乐领域，以及他们选择录制的内容，深刻揭示了音乐产业在音乐生产中所扮演的角色。

Edison unwittingly provided a glimpse of the future when he chose to introduce the phonograph by highlighting its novelty value. In countless public demonstrations in Great Britain and the United States, vocalists, whistlers, and local instrumentalists from the audience were invited to make live recordings on the spot, anticipating what would become the dominant use of the invention. Other than the spoken word, it was found that brass reproduced best. Because of the poor sound quality of Edison's early tinfoil cylinders, however, Edison himself dismissed the phonograph as "a mere toy, which has no commercial value"[^9] and put the project on the shelf, but only temporarily.

> Edison 在无意中预示了未来，当他选择通过强调其新奇价值来介绍留声机时。在英国和美国的无数公开演示中，来自观众的歌手、口哨手和当地乐器演奏家被邀请现场录制，预见了这项发明将成为主要用途。除了口语外，人们发现铜管乐器的再现效果最好。然而，由于 Edison 早期锡箔圆筒的音质差，Edison 本人将留声机斥为“仅仅是个玩具，没有商业价值”[^9]，并将项目搁置，但只是暂时的。

The next steps in the development of sound recording in the United States were taken in Bell Laboratories and eventually consolidated into the North American Phonograph Company, a national combine focused on office technology. It was Louis Glass, manager of North American's West Coast franchise, who pointed the way to the future. Beginning in 1889 Glass placed these "dictating" machines in the Palais Royal Saloon in San Francisco where patrons could listen to a prerecorded "entertainment" cylinder for a nickel. Within a year, these "nickel in the slot" machines were bringing in as much as $1,200 annually. The enterprise earned Glass a place in music history as the Father of the Jukebox.

> 美国录音技术发展的后续步骤在 Bell Laboratories 展开，并最终整合成立了 North American Phonograph Company，这是一家专注于办公技术的全国性联合企业。正是 North American 西海岸特许经营经理 Louis Glass 指明了未来的方向。自 1889 年起，Glass 将这些“听写”机器放置在旧金山的 Palais Royal Saloon 中，顾客只需支付一枚五分镍币，即可聆听预先录制的“娱乐”蜡筒。不到一年，这些“投币式”机器每年能带来高达 1,200 美元的收入。这项事业为 Glass 赢得了音乐史上的地位，被誉为“点唱机之父”。

The Columbia Phonograph Company, North American's District of Columbia franchise, quickly distinguished itself as the leading producer of quality entertainment cylinders. Among those that caught on with the mainstream listening audience were spoken-word comic Irish tales, "coon" songs, which exploited negative stereotypes of African Americans, and brass bands. By 1892 Columbia had issued about 100 recordings of the United States Marine Band, which included Sousa marches and Strauss waltzes, among other favorites.

> 哥伦比亚留声机公司，作为北美地区哥伦比亚特区的特许经营商，迅速脱颖而出，成为优质娱乐圆筒唱片的领先制造商。在主流听众中广受欢迎的作品包括口述喜剧爱尔兰故事、利用非裔美国人负面刻板印象的“黑脸歌曲”，以及铜管乐队的演奏。截至 1892 年，哥伦比亚公司已发行了约 100 张美国海军陆战队乐队的录音，其中收录了苏萨进行曲、施特劳斯圆舞曲以及其他经典作品。

It was German American immigrant Emile Berliner who first envisaged the contours of the modern music industry full-blown. Berliner had developed a recording process based on a flat disc for a machine he called the gramophone. At its very first demonstration in 1888, Berliner prophesied the ability to make an unlimited number of copies from a single master, the development of a mass-scale home-entertainment market for recorded music, and a system of royalty payments to artists derived from the sale of discs.[^10]

> 正是德裔美国移民 Emile Berliner 首次完整构想了现代音乐产业的雏形。Berliner 开发了一种基于扁平圆盘的录音工艺，用于他称之为留声机的设备。在 1888 年的首次演示中，Berliner 预言了从单一母版无限复制唱片的能力、录音音乐大规模家庭娱乐市场的发展，以及一套从唱片销售中向艺术家支付版税的体系。[^10]

During this same time frame, similar developments were being undertaken elsewhere in the industrialized world. The work of Charles and Emile Pathé in Paris paralleled the development of the Edison phonograph. Opening their first phonograph factory in the Paris suburb of Chatou in 1894, Pathé Frères became a full-fledged recording company in 1897. That same year William Barry Owen left his position as head of Berliner's National Gramophone Company in New York and established the Gramophone Company in London to exploit the Berliner European gramophone patents. Deutsche Grammophon, another related company, was set up by Joseph Berliner in Hanover, Germany. Then, in 1901, Emile Berliner founded the Victor Talking Machine Company in the United States.

> 在同一时期，工业化世界的其他地区也出现了类似的发展进程。Charles 与 Emile Pathé 在巴黎的工作与 Edison 留声机的发展同步推进。Pathé Frères 于 1894 年在巴黎郊区的 Chatou 开设了首家留声机工厂，并于 1897 年发展成为一家成熟的录音公司。同年，William Barry Owen 辞去了 Berliner 在纽约的国家留声机公司负责人职务，并在伦敦创立了留声机公司，以利用 Berliner 在欧洲的留声机专利。另一家相关企业 Deutsche Grammophon 由 Joseph Berliner 在德国汉诺威设立。随后在 1901 年，Emile Berliner 在美国成立了维克多留声机公司。

Even though these companies knew that they were headed for entertainment—not dictation—the fledgling industry faced a number of serious roadblocks—technical, legal, and financial. Because of their limited sound quality, early recordings tended to favor spoken-word and instrumental selections; writers and publishers were not yet entitled to receive royalties from the sale or use of recorded music; and, because cylinders couldn't yet be mass produced, manufacturing couldn't compete with the consumer demand that already existed for sheet music. In addition, a series of patent wars prevented the industry from progressing smoothly. After the turn of the century, however, the major recording companies determined that pooling their patents would advance the technology, as well as their economic self-interest, far more rapidly and, in the process, provide them with a form of oligopolistic control of the industry.

> 尽管这些公司明知自己正迈向娱乐领域——而非听写记录——这一新兴行业仍面临着技术、法律和财务等多重严峻障碍。由于早期录音的音质有限，录制内容往往偏向口语和器乐选段；作家与出版商尚未获得录制音乐销售或使用版税的权利；同时，由于蜡筒尚未实现大规模生产，其制造能力无法满足市场上已有的乐谱消费需求。此外，一系列专利战争阻碍了行业的顺利发展。然而进入新世纪后，主要唱片公司意识到，通过专利共享能更快推动技术进步，这既符合他们的经济利益，也能在过程中形成对行业的寡头垄断控制。

Emile Berliner delivered on his first prophecy when he made negative discs called "stampers," which evolved into the shellac-based, 78-rpm pressings that went on to become the industry standard until the late 1940s. He then contracted with an enterprising machinist named Eldridge R. Johnson, who developed a competitive twenty-five-dollar machine, creating the possibility of a home-entertainment market for records. To realize his second prophecy, Berliner judged correctly that he would need someone with more musical ability than himself to coordinate talent and recording. A single demonstration of the "beautiful round tones" of Berliner's disc was enough to lure Columbia's Fred Gaisberg—in effect, the first a&R (artist and repertoire) man/producer—to Victor.

> Emile Berliner 兑现了他的第一个预言，当他制作了称为 stampers 的负片盘，这些盘演变成了基于虫胶的 78 转压片，直到 1940 年代末成为行业标准。然后他与一位名叫 Eldridge R. Johnson 的有进取心的机械师签约，后者开发了一台具有竞争力的二十五美元机器，为唱片创造了家庭娱乐市场的可能性。为了实现他的第二个预言，Berliner 正确判断出他需要一个比他自己更有音乐才能的人来协调人才和录音。一次对 Berliner 唱片的“美丽圆润音调”的演示就足以让 Columbia 的 Fred Gaisberg——实际上，第一位 a&R（艺术家和曲目）人/制作人——吸引维克多留声机公司。

If Berliner was the industrial visionary, Gaisberg provided the cultural input. Because recording artists weren't yet paid royalties and received no credit on records or in catalogues, Gaisberg had relatively little trouble persuading popular Columbia artists to record for Victor. Neither was he limited to performers in the United States. Gaisberg had already set up the first recording studio in London in 1898 before he moved from Columbia to Victor. Then in the early 1900s Victor acquired 50 percent ownership of the British Gramophone Company.[^11] Through the efforts of William Barry Owen, Gaisberg was soon recording in every music capital in Europe and Russia.

> 如果 Berliner 是工业远见者，那么 Gaisberg 提供了文化输入。因为录音艺术家尚未获得版税，并且在唱片或目录中没有得到署名，Gaisberg 相对容易地说服了流行的 Columbia 艺术家为 Victor 录音。他也不限于 United States 的表演者。Gaisberg 在 1898 年已经在 London 建立了第一个录音室，然后他从 Columbia 转到 Victor。然后在 1900 年代早期，Victor 收购了 British Gramophone Company 的 50% 所有权。[^11]通过 William Barry Owen 的努力，Gaisberg 很快在 Europe 和 Russia 的每个音乐首都进行录音。

Because of an elitist bias toward high culture, European classical music was considered to be the hallmark of good taste and opera singers occupied the highest rung on the entertainment ladder. Accordingly, the British Gramophone Company catalogue included songs and arias in every European language and many Asian languages as well. Gaisberg also made recordings at the Imperial Opera in Russia. In 1902 Italian tenor Enrico Caruso recorded ten arias in a hotel room in Milan for Gramophone, helping to establish the company as a serious outlet for classical as well as popular music. Eldridge Johnson imported these higher priced "Red Seal" recordings for sale in the United States and then began a domestic Red Label series of his own, which featured the stars of the Metropolitan Opera in New York.[^12] Producer C. G. Childs placed a jewel in the crown of the new series when he signed Caruso to an exclusive Victor contract by offering him the unprecedented provision of a royalty on records sold, thereby fulfilling the last of Berliner's 1888 prophecies.

> 由于对高雅文化的精英主义偏见，欧洲古典音乐被视为品味的标志，歌剧歌手占据了娱乐阶梯的最高层。因此，British Gramophone Company 的目录包含了各种欧洲语言和许多亚洲语言的歌曲和咏叹调。Gaisberg 还在俄罗斯的 Imperial Opera 进行了录音。1902 年，意大利男高音 Enrico Caruso 在米兰的一家酒店房间里为 Gramophone 录制了十首咏叹调，帮助该公司成为古典音乐和流行音乐的严肃发行渠道。Eldridge Johnson 进口了这些价格更高的“红印鉴”录音在美国销售，然后开始了自己的国内 Red Label 系列，该系列以纽约 Metropolitan Opera 的明星为特色。[^12]制作人 C. G. Childs 通过签署 Caruso 独家 Victor 合同，为他提供前所未有的唱片销售版税条款，从而为这个新系列加冕，实现了 Berliner 1888 年预言的最后一项。

In the 1910s the recording industry extended its tentacles into the most lucrative markets of the world, through pressing plants in the most important areas and through a network of subsidiaries elsewhere. The two largest and most powerful companies, U.S. Victor and British Gramophone, furthered their mutual interests by dividing portions of the globe cooperatively. Victor had the Americas, North and South, and what they called the Far East; Gramophone operated factories in Europe, Russia, and India. After the outbreak of World War I the assets of Deutsche Grammophon were confiscated by the German government as enemy property, forcing a split between the British and German companies. By this time, however, Germany's Lindström company had become an international player and Pathé was not far behind.[^13]

> 20 世纪 10 年代，唱片业通过在全球最重要地区设立压制工厂，并在其他地区构建子公司网络，将其触角延伸至世界最具盈利潜力的市场。两家规模最大且实力最雄厚的公司——美国 Victor 与英国 Gramophone，通过合作划分全球市场以促进共同利益。Victor 拥有南北美洲及他们所称的远东地区；Gramophone 则在欧洲、俄罗斯和印度运营工厂。第一次世界大战爆发后，德国政府将 Deutsche Grammophon 的资产作为敌产没收，迫使英国与德国公司分道扬镳。然而此时，德国的 Lindström 公司已成为国际市场上的重要参与者，Pathé 公司亦紧随其后。[^13]

By this time, it was clear that records would become a powerful cultural force. In 1909, the United States alone manufactured more than 27 million discs and cylinders, with a wholesale value of nearly S12 million.[^14] Comparable figures from around the world were equally impressive. One observer estimated German record production at 18 million copies (including exports) in 1907, Russian sales at 20 million copies in 1915, and the British and French markets at 10 million units each in the same time frame.[^15] It was figures such as these which caused the publishers to stand up and take notice.

> 此时，唱片显然已成为一股强大的文化力量。在 1909 年，仅美国就生产了超过 2700 万张唱片和唱筒，批发总值接近 1200 万美元。[^14]世界各地的相关数据同样令人瞩目。一位观察者估计，德国在 1907 年的唱片产量（包括出口）达到 1800 万张，俄罗斯在 1915 年的销量为 2000 万张，而同期英国和法国市场各自达到 1000 万张的规模。[^15]正是这样的数字引起了出版商的关注和重视。

While the economic vision of the major record companies was nothing short of world domination, their cultural strategy at this time was seemingly more democratic. All of the major companies not only exported their own domestic products internationally, they also recorded and distributed local artists in the countries where they operated, "so that by the early 1910s, Icelandic, Estonian, Welsh and Breton record buyers, the ethnic minorities of the Russian Empire, the twenty largest immigrant groups in the United States, and the most important groups of the Indian subcontinent were all supplied by recordings of their own musical traditions."[^16] Given the history of European colonialism and patterns of racism in the United States, however, it is likely that this broad range of cultural products resulted more from considerations of cost effectiveness than a commitment to cultural diversity.

> 虽然主要唱片公司的经济愿景无异于世界统治，但此时他们的文化策略似乎更加民主。所有主要公司不仅在国际上出口自己的国内产品，还在运营的国家录制和分发当地艺术家的作品，“因此到 1910 年代初，Icelandic、Estonian、Welsh 和 Breton 的唱片买家，Russian Empire 的少数民族，United States 的二十个最大移民群体，以及 Indian subcontinent 最重要的群体，都获得了自己音乐传统的录音。”[^16]鉴于 European 殖民主义的历史和 United States 的种族主义模式，然而，这种广泛的文化产品更可能是出于成本效益的考虑，而非对文化多样性的承诺。

It is also the case that there were (and are) pronounced biases in the way that the music industry conceived of itself and its world. Africa (with the occasional exception of South Africa) and certain other locales are conspicuously absent in much of the writing about the early internationalization of the music industry. Even within the industrialized world, there was internal class and race stratification. Record companies were slow to learn the cultural lesson that while the European classics brought prestige to their labels, the steady income—indeed, the future of the recording industry—was tied more to popular appetites. Victor's prestigious Red Seal series never accounted for more than 20 percent of the sales of the popular black-label recordings.[^17] While the record companies grappled with the tension between an elite conception of culture and the financial realities of popular taste, many rich sources of musical culture went beneath their notice, particularly within regions that were insufficiently penetrated by capital and/or populations that were too poor to be thought of as consumers.

> 音乐行业在构想自身及其世界的方式上存在（并且仍然存在）明显的偏见。在关于音乐行业早期国际化的许多著作中，非洲（偶尔除南非外）和其他某些地区明显缺席。即使在工业化世界内部，也存在内部的阶级和种族分层。唱片公司迟迟未能吸取文化教训：尽管欧洲经典作品为它们的品牌带来了声望，但稳定收入——实际上，录音行业的未来——更多地与大众口味挂钩。Victor 的红印鉴系列从未占流行黑标唱片销售额的 20% 以上。[^17]当唱片公司在精英文化观念与大众口味的财务现实之间的张力中挣扎时，许多丰富的音乐文化资源未被它们注意到，特别是在资本渗透不足的地区和/或过于贫困而未被视为消费者的人群中。

Significant cultural blind spots notwithstanding, by the 1910s the recording industry was clearly in an ascending phase, one which, with numerous fits and starts, would continue. The addition of a mechanical royalty to the copyright laws in the early twentieth century was timely in that it opened the door for collaborations between publishers and recording companies which had not existed previously. Companies in Great Britain and the United States were particularly well served, as a lucrative market for musical theater albums was discovered among American soldiers and native Britons during World War I when Gramophone issued a recording of the songs from Business as Usual, a popular musical revue. This was followed by recordings of two of Irving Berlin's shows, Watch Your Step and Cheep, with equal success. Victor emulated the success of its British partner by recording the best-known stage entertainers in the United States. Columbia and Edison soon followed suit.

> 尽管存在显著的文化盲点，但到 1910 年代，录音行业显然处于上升阶段，这一阶段尽管有诸多起伏，仍将持续。二十世纪初，版权法中增加机械版税是及时的，因为它为出版商和录音公司之间的合作打开了大门，这种合作以前并不存在。英国和美国的公司尤其受益，因为在一战期间，当 Gramophone 发行了流行音乐剧 Business as Usual 的歌曲录音时，在美国士兵和英国本土居民中发现了一个有利可图的音乐剧专辑市场。随后，Irving Berlin 的两部音乐剧 Watch Your Step 和 Cheep 的录音也取得了同样的成功。Victor 通过录制美国最知名的舞台艺人，效仿了其英国合作伙伴的成功。Columbia 和 Edison 很快也纷纷效仿。

It should be noted that there were distinctions between the new copyright laws which differentially affected the standing of record companies in different countries. While both the U.S. and British revisions added mechanical rights to already existing performing rights, enabling publishers to extend their reach to a new medium, the British law also included language that was later used to argue for an additional right, referred to somewhat confusingly as a "performance right," which enabled record companies to claim a copyright that inheres in the recording itself "as if such contrivances were musical works."[^18] The performance right allows a record company to recover a royalty when a record is used for a public performance, as in a jukebox or on the radio. In Great Britain, Phonographic Performance Ltd. (PPL) was set up to administer these payments and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) was established to lobby other governments for similar provisions in their domestic laws.

> 需要注意的是，新版权法之间存在区别，这些区别对不同国家唱片公司的地位产生了不同影响。尽管 U.S. 和 British 的修订版都将机械权添加到已有的表演权中，使出版商能够扩展到新媒介，但 British 法律还包括了后来被用来主张一项额外权利的措辞，这项权利有些令人困惑地被称为“表演权”，它使唱片公司能够声称录音本身固有的版权，“仿佛这些装置是音乐作品一样。”[^18]表演权允许唱片公司在唱片被用于公开表演时收取版税，例如在点唱机或广播中。英国设立了Phonographic Performance Ltd. (PPL) 来管理这些支付，而 International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) 则建立来游说其他政府在其国内法中纳入类似规定。

While a number of countries adopted copyright provisions similar to Great Britain's, others—such as France and the United States—did not acknowledge a copyright in records as such.[^19] Performance rights were hotly debated in the 1976 revision to the U.S. Copyright Law, but even at that late date Congress decided that the issue required further study. Consequently, no provision was included in the final legislation; indeed, Section 114 (a) states explicitly that the owner's rights "do not include any right of performance," effectively killing the measure. The failure to adopt a performance right has serious consequences, particularly for recording artists with a signature sound, which were made clear in the report of the House Judiciary Committee on the 1976 legislation. "Mere imitation of a recorded performance would not constitute a copyright infringement," said the committee, "even where one performer deliberately sets out to simulate another's performance as exactly as possible."[^20]

> 尽管许多国家采纳了与英国相似的版权条款，但其他国家——例如法国和美国——并未承认唱片本身享有版权。[^19]表演权在 1976 年 U.S. Copyright Law 的修订过程中引发了激烈辩论，但即便到了如此晚近的时期，国会仍认为该问题需要进一步研究。因此，最终立法中并未包含相关条款；事实上，第 114(a) 条明确规定版权所有者的权利“不包括任何表演权”，这实质上扼杀了该提案。未能确立表演权产生了严重后果，尤其对那些拥有标志性声音的录音艺术家而言，这一点在众议院司法委员会关于 1976 年立法的报告中已明确说明。委员会指出：“单纯模仿已录制的表演并不构成版权侵权，即使一位表演者刻意试图尽可能精确地模拟另一位的表演。”[^20]

In addition to the complexity of performing rights, performance rights, and mechanicals, the 1928 Rome revision to the Berne Convention introduced the concept of "moral rights," which granted an author the right to be properly identified and guarded against any editing or other alteration of a work that would compromise its integrity. As with other provisions of Berne, however, the moral rights provision was optional. Again, the United States was significant among the countries that opted out of this provision, even after it signed on to Berne.

> 除了表演权、表演权和机械复制权的复杂性之外，1928 年 Rome 对《伯尔尼条约》的修订引入了“道德权利”的概念，这授予作者被正确识别的权利，并保护作品免受任何可能损害其完整性的编辑或其他修改。然而，与 Berne 的其他条款一样，道德权利条款是可选的。再次，美国在那些选择退出此条款的国家中显得突出，即使在其签署《伯尔尼条约》之后。

Amid the growing complexity of the music industry, it appeared as though the market for recorded music was virtually unlimited. Gross revenues in the United States hit an all-time high of $106 million in 1921, with comparable growth being reported elsewhere in the industrialized world. The expiration of the original talking-machine patents in the mid-teens enabled a number of new companies to enter the record business. Unsated consumer demand in the areas of blues and country music—known at the time as race and hillbilly—even allowed for the formation of some Black-owned indies such as Black Swan, Sunshine, Merritt, and Black Patti. Pathé opened a branch in New York and Lindström started OKeh Records. At this point, however, the U.S. record market stalled—even as record sales were still climbing in other countries. Two years after the advent of commercial radio broadcasting in 1920, annual record revenues in the United States declined immediately and then plummeted to an all-time low of $6 million in 1933, at the height of the Great Depression. By this time the depression had adversely affected all record-producing nations. To avoid bankruptcy, British Gramophone merged with the Columbia Graphophone Company (the European arm of U.S.-based Columbia) to form Electric and Musical Industries (EMI). In the United States, the major radio networks acquired their first record divisions; RCA merged with Victor in 1929 and CBS bought Columbia Records in the mid-thirties. As is often the case in the music business, technological advances have a way of changing existing power relationships and influencing cultural choices. The introduction of radio—a new medium that not only delivered live music with better sound quality than records, but did so free of charge—initially lessened the appeal of records.

> 在音乐行业日益复杂的背景下，录音音乐的市场似乎几乎是无限的。美国的毛收入在 1921 年达到了 1.06 亿美元的历史最高点，工业化世界的其他地方也报告了类似的增长。原始留声机专利在1910年代中期到期，使得许多新公司得以进入唱片行业。在 blues 和 country music 领域未满足的消费者需求——当时被称为 race 和 hillbilly——甚至允许一些 Black-owned indies 的形成，例如 Black Swan、Sunshine、Merritt 和 Black Patti。Pathé 在 New York 开设了分支机构，而 Lindström 创立了 OKeh Records。然而，在这一点上，美国唱片市场停滞不前——尽管其他国家的唱片销售仍在攀升。1920 年商业无线电广播出现两年后， United States 的年度唱片收入立即下降，然后在 1933 年大萧条高峰时暴跌至 600 万美元的历史最低点。到这时，大萧条已经对所有唱片生产国产生了不利影响。为避免破产， British Gramophone 与 Columbia Graphophone Company （ U.S.-based Columbia 的欧洲分支）合并，形成了 Electric and Musical Industries （ EMI ）。在 United States ，主要无线电网络收购了他们的第一个唱片部门； RCA 在 1929 年与 Victor 合并，而 CBS 在 mid-thirties 购买了 Columbia Records 。正如音乐业务中常见的情况，技术进步有办法改变现有的权力关系并影响文化选择。无线电的引入——一种不仅提供比唱片音质更好的现场音乐，而且免费的新媒体——最初降低了唱片的吸引力。

## Radio Broadcasting: Empires of the Air
**广播电台：空中帝国**

Radio was one of those developments that clearly resulted from an international process of shared knowledge, beginning with the discovery of electromagnetic waves by the German scientist Heinrich Hertz in the early 1890s. Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi developed the first practical applications of "Hertzian waves" in the field of telegraphy and set up shop in Britain and the United States by the beginning of the twentieth century. Canadian Reginald Fessenden led the way from telegraphic to telephonic transmissions, but could not compete with the dramatic broadcasts of phonograph music from the Eiffel Tower (1908) or Caruso from the Metropolitan Opera in New York (1910), engineered by Lee de Forest, an American whose country was determined to dominate the new technology.

> 无线电是那些明显源于国际共享知识过程的进步之一，始于德国科学家 Heinrich Hertz 在 1890 年代初对电磁波的发现。意大利发明家 Guglielmo Marconi 开发了“赫兹波”在电报领域的首次实际应用，并在 20 世纪 初在英国和美国设立了业务。加拿大发明家 Reginald Fessenden 引领了从电报传输到电话传输的道路，但无法与从 Eiffel Tower（1908）播放留声机音乐或从 Metropolitan Opera in New York（1910）播放 Caruso 的戏剧性广播相竞争，这些广播由美国人 Lee de Forest 设计，他的国家决心主导这项新技术。

Owing to the ascending economic power and military might of the United States following World War I, it disproportionately reaped the benefits of commercial broadcasting (as well as the major technical advances of the next thirty years). During World War I the commercial development of radio was temporarily halted by the Allies in order to devote all further research and application to the war effort. Since this pooling of resources effectively meant a moratorium on patent suits, the war years encouraged technical advances at a crucial period in the development of radio which might not otherwise have been possible. Once the war was over, it was clear that there was a future for radio, and Marconi, headquartered in Britain, set his sights on nothing less than a worldwide monopoly on wireless communication. But the U.S. government felt otherwise.

> 由于第一次世界大战后美国经济实力与军事实力的崛起，该国在商业广播领域（以及随后三十年的重大技术进步中）获得了不成比例的收益。第一次世界大战期间，无线电的商业化发展曾因同盟国的干预而暂时停滞，以便将所有后续研究与运用集中于战事需求。由于这种资源整合实质上意味着专利诉讼的暂停，战争年代在无线电发展的关键阶段促进了技术进步，而这在和平时期或许难以实现。战争结束后，无线电的未来前景已然明朗，总部位于英国的 Marconi 将目标锁定为在全球范围内垄断无线通信。然而美国政府对此持有不同立场。

Because President Woodrow Wilson saw mass communication as a key element in the balance of world power, he found the prospect of a British-dominated monopoly on radio unacceptable. Once the president of American Marconi understood his position, he dryly told his stockholders in 1919, "We have found that there exists on the part of the officials of the [U.S.] Government a very strong and irremovable objection to [American Marconi] because of the stock interest held therein by the British Company.[^21] When all was said and done, the operations and assets of American Marconi had been transferred to a new entity—the Radio Corporation of America (RCA)—a holding company for American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T), who manufactured transmitters, General Electric (GE) and Westinghouse, who made receivers, and the former stockholders of American Marconi.

> 由于 Woodrow Wilson 总统将大众传播视为世界权力平衡的关键要素，他认为由英国主导的无线电垄断前景是不可接受的。当美国马可尼公司总裁明确其立场后，他于 1919 年冷淡地告知股东："我们发现，[美国]政府官员方面存在非常强烈且无法消除的反对意见，反对[美国马可尼公司]，因为英国公司持有其股份。[^21] 归根结底，美国马可尼公司的运营与资产已转移至一个新实体——美国无线电公司（RCA）——这是一个控股公司，其组成包括制造发射器的美国电话电报公司（AT&T）、生产接收器的通用电气（GE）与西屋公司，以及美国马可尼公司的原股东。

With future developments in radio firmly in U.S. hands, the advent of broadcasting internationally proceeded according to a number of different models. In their pathbreaking study of the international music industry, Roger Wallis and Krister Malm identified three main types—public service, purely commercial, and government controlled—which are derived from archetypes of the historical development of radio.[^22] In practice none of these ideal types exist in pure form, and many systems were hybrids from the start or changed over time. In France, for example, some early radio stations were operated by the government, while others were owned by schools or private companies. In Germany, a somewhat independent system of educational and entertainment programs was nationalized by the Nazis in 1933 so as to better exploit the value of radio as a unifying political force.

> 随着无线电的未来发展牢牢掌握在美国手中，国际广播的兴起遵循了多种不同的模式。Roger Wallis 和 Krister Malm 在其开创性的国际音乐产业研究中，依据无线电发展的历史原型，归纳出三种主要类型——公共服务型、纯商业型以及政府管控型。[^22]实践中这些理想类型均不存在纯粹形式，许多体系自始便是混合形态或随时间推移发生变化。例如在法国，早期广播电台部分由政府运营，另一些则由学校或私营企业所有。在德国，一套相对独立的教育与娱乐节目体系于 1933 年被纳粹国有化，以便更好地利用无线电作为凝聚性政治力量的价值。

Britain's BBC is generally considered the archetypal public-service system. According to the BBC website, "John Reith, the BBC's founding father, looked westwards in the 1920s to America's unregulated, commercial radio, and then east to the fledgling Soviet Union's rigidly controlled state system. Reith's vision was of an independent British broadcaster able to 'educate, inform and entertain' the whole nation, free from political interference and commercial pressure."[^23] By the time a schedule of daily broadcasts that included drama, news, and children's programs, as well as classical and popular music, went "on the air" over London's 2LO station, more than one million tenshilling listening licenses had been issued to help insure the independence of the enterprise. Still, BBC radio has hardly been free from government intervention in the censorship of popular music.

> 英国的 BBC 通常被视为公共服务体系的典范。根据 BBC 官网所述：“BBC 的创始人 John Reith 在 20 世纪 20 年代曾向西观察美国未经监管的商业广播，又向东审视新生苏联严格受控的国家体系。Reith 的愿景是建立一个独立的英国广播机构，能够‘教育、告知并娱乐’全体国民，免受政治干预和商业压力的影响。”[^23]到了每日节目表——包含戏剧、新闻、儿童节目以及古典与流行音乐——通过伦敦的 2LO 电台“开播”时，已有超过一百万份十先令的收听许可证被发放，用以保障这一事业的独立性。尽管如此，BBC 电台在流行音乐的审查方面仍难以完全摆脱政府的干预。

Telephonic broadcasting began earlier in both the United States and the Soviet Union. During the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, radio stations were considered important assets for the new society. Because of the sheer size of the new federation, the lack of infrastructure, high levels of illiteracy, and the diversity of nationalities, Lenin reasoned quite correctly that radio would provide the most effective means of communicating with the masses. "Every village should have radio," opined Lenin. "Every government office, as well as every club in our factories should be aware that at a certain hour they will hear political news and major events of the day. This way our country will lead a life of highest political awareness, constantly knowing actions of the government and views of the people.[^24] Control of Soviet radio was placed in the hands of the People's Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs and, in 1921, the agency began a series of daily broadcasts called the "Spoken Newspaper of the Russian Telegraph Agency." Because individual receivers were too expensive for private use, loudspeakers were installed in public areas for reception.

> 电话广播在美国和苏联都起步较早。在 1917 年布尔什维克革命期间，广播电台被视为新社会的重要资产。由于新联邦幅员辽阔、基础设施匮乏、文盲率高以及民族多样性，列宁相当正确地推断，广播将成为与群众沟通的最有效手段。列宁曾提出：“每个村庄都应当拥有无线电，每个政府机关以及我们工厂的每个俱乐部都应当知道，在特定时间可以收听到政治新闻和当日重大事件。这样，我们的国家将生活在最高政治觉悟中，时刻了解政府的行动和人民的意见。”[^24] 苏联广播的控制权被交给邮电人民委员部，并于 1921 年开始每日播送名为“俄罗斯通讯社口语报”的系列广播节目。由于个人接收设备对私人使用而言过于昂贵，当局便在公共场所安装扩音器以供收听。

Although broadcasting in the United States was conceived as a commercial enterprise from the start, it began with the same lofty rhetoric as the BBC regarding education and raising the general level of culture. In the United States, the tension between such elite notions of culture and the dictates of popular taste played itself out in a pivotal debate between the more dignified old guard programmers and a new breed of unabashedly commercial advertisers.

> 尽管美国的广播事业自诞生之初便被构想为一种商业企业，它却与英国广播公司 BBC 一样，在起步时秉持着关于教育和提升大众文化水平的崇高言辞。在美国，这种精英文化观念与大众品味要求之间的张力，通过一场关键辩论得以展现——一方是更为庄重的传统节目制作人，另一方则是毫不掩饰商业意图的新型广告商。

A regular schedule of broadcasting began in the United States in November of 1920 when the Westinghouse station KDKA went live from the roof of their Pittsburgh factory, reporting the results of the Harding/Cox presidential election. Within two to three years, nearly 600 stations were licensed to operate, with few precedents to guide their development. The existing legislation, designed primarily to govern maritime telegraphy, did not anticipate the impact of commercialized telephonic broadcasting. Issues such as programming, financing, organization, ownership, networking, interference, and advertising were worked out in practice and over time as they arose.

> 常规广播节目安排始于 1920 年 11 月的美国，当时 Westinghouse 旗下的 KDKA 电台从其匹兹堡工厂的屋顶进行了首次直播，报道了 Harding/Cox 总统选举的结果。在两到三年内，近 600 家电台获得了运营许可，而当时几乎没有任何先例可指导其发展。主要针对海上电报通信设计的现有法律，并未预见到商业化电话广播的影响。诸如节目内容、资金筹措、组织架构、所有权归属、网络构建、信号干扰以及广告投放等问题，都是在实践过程中随着出现而逐步得到解决的。

Though U.S. legislation was premised on a system of independent stations, radio quickly became concentrated in the hands of two giant corporations, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and National Broadcasting Company (NBC), a subsidiary of RCA that operated the Red and Blue networks. By the 1930s coast-to-coast network broadcasting was a reality and NBC and CBS already owned 50 of the 52 clear channels—stations with large transmitters positioned to broadcast over great distances with minimal interference—as well as 75 percent of the most powerful regional stations. In terms of ownership patterns, U.S. radio developed as a very private enterprise. Programming, however, was a different matter.

> 尽管美国立法是基于独立电台体系，但广播业迅速集中于两大巨头企业手中，即哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）和全国广播公司（NBC）。NBC作为美国无线电公司（RCA）的子公司，运营着红网与蓝网广播网络。到 20 世纪 30 年代，横跨东西海岸的全国性广播网络已成为现实。NBC 与 CBS 已掌控全美 52 个清晰频道中的 50 个（这些频道配备大功率发射机，可实现远距离低干扰广播），并拥有 75% 的最高功率区域电台。就所有权模式而言，美国广播业发展呈现出高度私有化特征。然而，节目制作领域则呈现截然不同的局面。

Consistent with radio's educational mission, news and dramatic series had been staples of broadcasting from the beginning, but the bulk of radio programming consisted of music.[^25] While the old-line programmers favored concerts of classical or semi-classical music to nourish the cultural sensibilities of the middle-class audience, the advertisers paid more attention to popular tastes. They tended more toward "dialect" comedy and popular song. In this, they were closer to the inclinations of Tin Pan Alley than those of the programmers, and the popular publishing houses, acting through ASCAP, were quick to reap the benefits.

> 遵循广播的教育使命，新闻与戏剧系列节目自广播诞生之初便是其核心内容，但广播节目的主体仍由音乐构成。[^25]尽管传统节目编排者倾向于通过古典或半古典音乐会来滋养中产阶级听众的文化感知，广告商却更关注大众喜好。他们更倾向于推广“方言”喜剧和流行歌曲，在此方面，他们更贴近锡盘巷（Tin Pan Alley）的倾向而非节目编排者的理念，而通过美国作曲家、作家与出版商协会（ASCAP）运作的流行音乐出版社迅速从中获益。

The advent of commercial advertising placed musical broadcasts within the public-performance-for-profit provision of the 1909 Copyright Act. By the end of 1924 "ASCAP income from 199 radio licenses was  $130,000, up from the previous year's $35,000 but far from the million predicted when the drive to collect from broadcasters began in the summer of 1922."[^26] By 1937 ASCAP's take from radio had jumped to $5.9 million. Considering ASCAP's demands excessive, the broadcasters began an adversarial relationship with the publishers, which led to the formation of a rival performing-rights organization in 1939—Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI)—and which continued well into the 1960s.

> 商业广告的出现将音乐广播置于 1909 年 Copyright Act 的营利性公开表演条款之下。到 1924 年底，“ASCAP 从 199 个广播许可证中获得的收入为 130,000 美元，高于上一年的 35,000 美元，但远未达到 1922 年夏季开始向广播公司收费时预测的百万美元。”[^26]到 1937 年，ASCAP 从广播中获得的收入跃升至 590 万美元。认为 ASCAP 的要求过高，广播公司开始与出版商对立，这导致了 1939 年一个竞争对手表演权组织——广播音乐公司（BMI）——的成立，并且这种对立一直持续到 20 世纪 60 年代。

No sooner had the broadcasters come to terms with ASCAP than they ran afoul of the American Federation of Musicians, who went to war over the use of "canned music" on radio. Training their sights on the record companies, the AFM struck the recording studios, a strategy intended to hurt record production and, at the same time, keep musicians working on radio. The AFM scored a short-term victory, as the demand for new releases outstripped the supply that the record companies had stockpiled. The strike ended when the record companies agreed to pay a royalty on record sales which was used to finance the Performance Trust Fund for out-of-work musicians. Still, it was inevitable that records would one day replace live musicians on radio.

> 广播公司才与美国作曲家、作家与出版商协会达成协议，就与美国音乐家联合会发生了冲突，该联合会因广播中使用“罐头音乐”而发起斗争。美国音乐家联合会将矛头指向唱片公司，对录音工作室发起罢工，这一策略旨在打击唱片生产，同时确保音乐家能在广播领域继续工作。由于市场对新发行的需求超过了唱片公司库存的供应量，美国音乐家联合会取得了短期胜利。当唱片公司同意支付唱片销售版税，用于资助失业音乐家的表演信托基金时，罢工才得以结束。然而，唱片终将取代广播中的现场乐手，这一趋势不可避免。

If the political economy of radio seemed far removed from the average listener, its social functions often touched people deeply. During the Depression, wrote Erik Barnouw, radio won "a loyalty that seemed almost irrational. Destitute families that had to give up an icebox or furniture or bedding still clung to the radio as to a last link with humanity."[^27] This reality was hardly wasted on President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the first "radio president," whose popular "Fireside Chats" provided him with a national following throughout his tenure in office.

> 如果说广播的政治经济学原理似乎与普通听众相距甚远，那么其社会功能却常常触动人心的深处。在大萧条时期，Erik Barnouw 写道，广播赢得了“一种近乎非理性的忠诚。那些不得不放弃冰箱、家具或床褥的赤贫家庭，仍然紧守着收音机，仿佛这是与人类文明最后的纽带。”[^27]这一现实并未被首位“广播总统” Franklin D. Roosevelt 所忽视，他广受欢迎的“炉边谈话”在其整个任期内为他赢得了全国性的追随。

Not unlike the Bolsheviks or the Nazis, Roosevelt immediately grasped the ideological potential of radio; in 1942 he authorized the Armed Forces Radio Service to keep U.S. troops stationed abroad informed and entertained, and to mount a direct challenge to the opposing ideology promoted by the likes of Axis Sally and Tokyo Rose. By 1945 the AFRS had expanded to a network of 150 outlets that crisscrossed the globe, with weekly shipments of news and music programming being distributed from its Los Angeles Broadcast Center. In this way a steady diet of U.S. military reportage as well as a sizable dose of U.S. popular culture were broadcast around the world.[^28]

> 与布尔什维克或纳粹并无不同，Roosevelt 迅速洞察了广播的意识形态潜力；在 1942 年，他授权成立武装部队广播服务，旨在为驻外美军提供信息与娱乐，并对 Axis Sally 和 Tokyo Rose 等人所宣扬的对立意识形态发起直接挑战。至 1945 年，武装部队广播服务已扩展为一个遍布全球的 150 个站点网络，其洛杉矶广播中心每周向各地输送新闻与音乐节目。通过这种方式，美军战事报道与大量美国流行文化持续不断地向全球传播。[^28]

On the homefront, the tension between high and popular culture in music programming had taken a turn toward the popular in one of the most interesting national prime-time experiments of the period—Your Hit Parade on NBC. Tapping into audience responses for programming decisions, the sponsor directed B. A. Rolfe and his thirty-five-piece orchestra to play only popular dance music with "no extravagant, bizarre, involved arrangements," so as to insure the "foxtrotability" of every selection programmed.[^29] In focusing solely on musical selections that were popular among the listening audience, Your Hit Parade was the first show to confer power in determining public taste on the consumer. Their " listener preference" letters foreshadowed the more "scientific" methods of rating that would eventually determine official popularity charts and format radio programming.

> 在国内，音乐节目编排中高雅文化与流行文化之间的紧张关系，在这一时期最有趣的国家黄金时段实验之一—— NBC 的 Your Hit Parade 中，转向了流行。为了根据观众反馈做出节目决策，赞助商指示 B. A. Rolfe 和他的三十五件乐器管弦乐队只演奏流行舞曲，要求“没有奢华、怪异、复杂的编曲”，以确保每个节目的“狐步舞可跳性”。[^29]通过只关注听众中流行的音乐选择，Your Hit Parade 是第一个将决定公众品味的权力赋予消费者的节目。他们的“听众偏好”信件预示了更“科学”的评分方法，这些方法最终将决定官方流行榜和格式化广播节目。

The tension between the "elevated" cultural tendencies of radio's old guard programmers and the straight commercial entertainment favored by the advertisers continued for years. Ultimately, the balance of power in programming favored the advertisers. As a result, radio has tended to follow the popular tastes of consumers, a tendency that had unanticipated consequences as rock and roll emerged in the early 1950s.

> 广播电台元老级节目制作人所秉持的“高雅”文化倾向，与广告商推崇的直接商业娱乐形式之间的张力持续了多年。最终，节目制作领域的权力平衡倒向了广告商一方。因此，广播内容往往追随大众消费者的喜好，这一趋势在 20 世纪 50 年代早期 rock and roll 兴起时带来了意想不到的后果。

## Technological Advances and Structural Change
**技术进步与结构变革**

A number of advances in audio technology that came into widespread usage in the 1940s set the stage for the emergence of rock and roll and major structural changes in the music industry. Among these were the inventions of magnetic tape and the transistor, and the advent of microgroove recording.

> 20 世纪 40 年代一系列音频技术的普及应用，为摇滚乐的诞生及音乐产业的结构性变革奠定了基础。其中包括磁带与晶体管的发明，以及密纹唱片录制技术的出现。

The concept and equipment for magnetic recording were first patented by the Danish engineer Valdemar Poulsen in 1898, but it was the Germans who perfected it. The German magnetophone developed by Telefunken and BASF used plastic tape coated with iron oxide, which could be magnetized by amplified electrical impulses to encode a signal on the material. Playback simply reversed the process. Aside from the obvious technical advantages of editing, splicing, and better sound reproduction, magnetic tape recording was also more durable, more portable, and less expensive than the existing technologies. The Nazis used the new technology to increase propaganda broadcasts during World War II, but there was no immediate application to the music industry, as the studios and manufacturing plants of Deutsche Grammophon (now owned by Seimens) in Berlin and Hanover had been destroyed by saturation bombing. As Germany rebuilt after the war, Deutsche Grammophon became the first company to use magnetic tape exclusively.

> 磁带录音的概念与设备最初由丹麦工程师 Valdemar Poulsen 于 1898 年获得专利，但将其完善的是德国人。由 Telefunken 和 BASF 共同研发的德国磁带录音机采用涂覆氧化铁的塑料磁带，可通过放大的电脉冲进行磁化，从而在材料上编码信号。回放过程则完全逆向进行。除了剪辑、拼接和更佳音质再现等显著技术优势外，磁带录音相较于既有技术还具有更耐用、更便携、更经济的特点。纳粹在二战期间曾运用这项新技术扩大宣传广播，但当时并未立即应用于音乐产业，因为柏林和汉诺威的德意志留声机公司（现属西门子旗下）录音室及制造厂已在饱和轰炸中被摧毁。随着战后德国的重建，德意志留声机公司成为首家全面采用磁带录音技术的企业。

Among the spoils of the war, magnetic tape was one of the items that was "liberated" from the Nazis. In the United States, the main beneficiary was the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), who came up with a tape that surpassed the sound quality of the German product and marketed it under their Scotch Tape trademark. Simultaneously, tape-recorder manufacturers were able to reduce recording speeds from thirty inches per second (ips) to fifteen ips and then to seven-and-a-half ips, without seriously compromising sound quality. The amount of material that could be recorded on a standard tape thus quadrupled. The advantages of tape were immediately apparent to recording companies and radio stations, who invested in the technology as soon as it became available.

> 在战争的战利品中，磁带是从纳粹处“缴获”的物品之一。在美国，主要受益者是明尼苏达矿业及制造公司（3M），该公司研制出一种音质超越德国产品的磁带，并以 Scotch Tape 商标进行市场推广。与此同时，磁带录音机制造商成功将录制速度从每秒 30 英寸降至 15 英寸，继而降至 7.5 英寸，且未对音质造成明显损害。因此，标准磁带可录制的材料容量实现了四倍增长。录音公司与广播电台立即认识到磁带的优势，并在该技术问世后迅速投入资金引进。

A welcome companion to the new recording technology was the transistor, introduced by U.S.-based Bell Telephone in 1948. Until the transistor, the amplification needed for radio broadcasting and electronic recording was tied to cumbersome and fragile vacuum tubes—a component based on Lee de Forest's audion, capable of generating, modulating, amplifying, and detecting radio energy. The transistor was capable of performing all the functions of the vacuum tube but in a solid environment. As such, it could be made smaller, required less power, and was more durable than the vacuum tube, which was soon replaced. This advance encouraged decentralization in broadcasting and recording, which aided independent production. On the consumption side, the transistor made possible truly portable radio receivers. Teenagers, who were soon to become an identifiable consumer group, could now explore their developing musical tastes in complete privacy.

> 伴随新录音技术而来的是一位受欢迎的伙伴——晶体管，它由美国的 Bell Telephone 公司于 1948 年推出。在晶体管问世之前，无线电广播和电子录音所需的放大功能一直依赖于笨重且易碎的真空管——这一组件基于 Lee de Forest 的检波放大管，能够生成、调制、放大和检测无线电能量。晶体管能够在固态环境下执行真空管的所有功能。因此，它可以做得更小、功耗更低，并且比真空管更耐用，后者很快便被取代。这一进步促进了广播和录音领域的去中心化，从而助力了独立制作的发展。在消费端，晶体管使得真正便携的无线电接收器成为可能。青少年——这个即将成为明确消费群体的群体——如今可以在完全私密的环境中探索他们正在形成的音乐品味。

The same year that the transistor was unveiled, a team of scientists working at CBS labs under the leadership of Dr. Peter Goldmark and William Bachman invented "high fidelity." Developed out of their interest in classical music, this breakthrough yielded the "microgroove" or "long-playing" 33-rpm record (the LP), which increased the number of grooves per inch on a standard record from eighty-five to three hundred. Not to be outdone, RCA responded with a similar product that played at 45 rpm. In what became known as the "battle of the speeds," the competition between the two giant firms produced vinylite discs of excellent sound quality and maximum durability. The 45, whose size caught the fancy of jukebox manufacturers, soon became the preferred configuration for singles. The LP became the industry standard for albums. Because these records were lighter and less breakable than shellac-based 78s, they could be shipped faster and more cheaply. Particularly because of these technological advances, records emerged as a relatively inexpensive medium, which held out the very real possibility of decentralization in the recording industry.

> 晶体管问世的同年，在 Peter Goldmark 博士与 William Bachman 的领导下，CBS 实验室的一组科学家发明了“高保真”技术。这项源于他们对古典音乐兴趣的突破性成果，催生了“密纹”或称“长时播放”的 33 转唱片（即 LP），将标准唱片每英寸的纹路数量从 85 条提升至 300 条。不甘示弱的 RCA 公司随即推出了以 45 转播放的类似产品。在这场被称为“速度之战”的竞争中，两大巨头的角逐生产出了音质卓越且极具耐久性的乙烯基唱片。45 转唱片因其尺寸受到自动点唱机制造商的青睐，迅速成为单曲唱片的首选规格。而 LP 则成为专辑的行业标准。由于这些唱片比虫胶材质的 78 转唱片更轻、更不易碎裂，其运输速度更快、成本更低。正是得益于这些技术进步，唱片逐渐成为一种相对廉价的媒介，为录音产业实现真正意义上的去中心化提供了切实可能。

Two policy decisions in the United States also had implications for the further development of popular music and the music industry. Owing to a shellac shortage during the war, which caused a cutback on the number of records that could be produced, the major U.S. labels made a strategic decision to abandon the production of African American music. This decision, coupled with technological advances favoring decentralization, created the conditions in the 1940s under which literally hundreds of small independent labels—among them Atlantic, Chess, Sun, King, Modern, Specialty, and Imperial—came into existence in the United States.

> 美国的两项政策决策亦对流行音乐及音乐产业的后续发展产生了深远影响。由于战争期间虫胶短缺导致唱片产量被迫削减，美国各大主流唱片公司做出了战略性决定，全面停止生产非裔美国人的音乐作品。此项决策，加之技术革新推动的产业分散化趋势，共同为 1940 年代创造了条件，使得美国境内涌现出数以百计的小型独立唱片公司——其中包括 Atlantic、Chess、Sun、King、Modern、Specialty 与 Imperial 等厂牌。

Another important policy decision—leading to the development of television—enabled these fledgling labels to gain a permanent foothold in the industry. The concept of transmitting images over distances had been around since the nineteenth century. As early as 1926 John Logie Baird experimented with a mechanical television system that became the basis for the BBC's first televisual transmissions. The current system of electronic television was first proposed by Scottish inventor A. A. Campbell-Swinton in 1908. It was developed in earnest in the United States at Westinghouse by Vladimir K. Zworykin, a refugee from the Bolshevik Revolution, using a cathode-ray tube invented by Karl Ferdinand Braun in Germany in 1897. In 1935 RCA decided to sink S1 million into the development of the new medium. One year later the BBC began its first regular public television broadcasts.

> 另一个重要的政策决定——导致电视的发展——使这些新兴的公司获得了永久的立足点。远距离传输图像的概念自十九世纪以来就已存在。早在 1926 年，John Logie Baird 实验了一种机械电视系统，这成为了 BBC 首次电视传输的基础。当前的电子电视系统最早由苏格兰发明家 A. A. Campbell-Swinton 在 1908 年提出。它在美国西屋公司由 Vladimir K. Zworykin，一位来自布尔什维克革命的难民，认真开发，使用了 Karl Ferdinand Braun 在德国于 1897 年发明的阴极射线管。在 1935 年，RCA 决定投入 100 万美元开发这种新媒体。一年后，BBC 开始了其首次定期的公共电视广播。

Television became a viable consumer item in the United States in the late 1940s. By 1951 there were nearly 16 million television sets in operation and RCA had already recovered its initial investment. Television signaled the death knell for network radio, as the new visual medium quickly attracted most of the national advertising. Interestingly, this had the effect of strengthening local independent radio, which emerged as the most effective vehicle for local advertisers—at a time when the number of radio stations in the United States had doubled from about 1,000 in 1946 to about 2,000 in 1948.

> 电视在 United States 的 20 世纪 40 年代末成为可行的消费品。到 1951 年，有近 1600 万 台电视机在运营，并且 RCA 已经收回了其初始投资。电视敲响了网络广播的丧钟，因为这种新的视觉媒体迅速吸引了大部分全国性广告。有趣的是，这起到了加强地方独立广播的作用，它成为地方广告商最有效的载体——当时 United States 的广播电台数量从 1946 年的大约 1000 家翻倍到 1948 年的大约 2000 家。

Local radio in the late forties and early fifties was a very loosely structured scene. Independent deejays—or "personality jocks" as they were called—were in control. As they replaced the live-entertainment personalities who dominated radio in the thirties and early forties, they became, for a time, the pivotal figures in the music industry. Relying on their own inventiveness for popularity, independent deejays often experimented with alternatives to the standard pop fare of network radio. In most cases the key to their musical success turned out to be rhythm and blues—the direct precursor of rock and roll—produced by independent labels.

> 20 世纪 40 年代末至 50 年代初，地方广播电台的结构相当松散。彼时，独立DJ——或称“个性主持人”——掌控着播音的主导权。随着他们逐步取代 30 年代至 40 年代初主导电台的现场娱乐艺人，这些DJ一度成为音乐产业中的核心人物。凭借个人创意博取听众青睐，他们常尝试突破广播网电台的标准流行乐模式，探索多元音乐选择。在多数情况下，其音乐成功的关键最终落于独立厂牌制作的节奏布鲁斯——这种音乐形式正是摇滚乐的直接前身。

The relationship between local radio and record companies also contributed to a major structural change in the music business. In the era of network radio, music was performed live by studio orchestras. In its search for cheaper forms of programming, however, independent radio turned to recorded music. The dawn of a new age was apparent when WINS in New York announced in 1950, over the strong objection of the American Federation of Musicians (AFM), that it would be programming records exclusively from then on. Since recorded music was now the rule for radio, record companies routinely supplied free copies of new releases to deejays in the hope that they could turn them into hits. Eventually, this practice cemented the reciprocal arrangement between radio and record companies that has defined the music industry ever since: inexpensive programming in return for free promotion.

> 地方电台与唱片公司之间的关系，亦促成了音乐产业的一次重大结构性变革。在网络电台时代，音乐主要由演播室乐队进行现场演奏。然而，独立电台在寻求更低成本的节目形式时，转向了录制音乐。当纽约的 WINS 电台于 1950 年宣布，尽管遭到美国音乐家联合会（AFM）的强烈反对，仍将从此完全采用唱片节目时，一个新时代的曙光已然显现。由于录制音乐已成为电台的常规内容，唱片公司开始定期向电台主持人免费提供新发行的唱片，以期将其打造成热门作品。最终，这一做法巩固了电台与唱片公司之间互惠互利的合作模式，并由此定义了此后音乐产业的基本格局：以低成本节目内容换取免费宣传。

Records became not only the staple of all radio programming but also the dominant product of the music industry as a whole, eclipsing sheet music as the dominant medium for music. Record companies thus displaced publishing houses as the power center of the music industry. Further, with technological advances favoring decentralization in recording and a climate of experimentation in radio, it became possible for small independent labels to challenge the few giant corporations that had monopolized the music business until this time. The stage was set for the emergence of rock and roll.

> 唱片不仅成为所有广播节目的核心内容，更作为音乐产业的主导产品全面崛起，取代活页乐谱成为音乐的主要媒介。唱片公司由此取代音乐出版社，成为音乐产业的权力中心。此外，随着技术进步推动录音领域的去中心化，以及广播行业形成的实验氛围，小型独立厂牌得以挑战此前一直垄断音乐行业的少数巨头企业。摇滚乐诞生的舞台已准备就绪。

## Cultural Transformation and Structural Change
**文化转型与结构变迁**

The eruption of rock and roll in the 1950s changed the popular music landscape permanently and irrevocably, signaling the advent of broader social change to come. It was a pivotal moment for a number of reasons. Economically, the music enhanced the fortunes of "untutored" artists, upstart independent record companies, and wildly eccentric deejays, turning the structure of the music business on its head. The vintage rock-and-roll years coincided with a period when the fortunes of the U.S. music industry nearly tripled; revenues from record sales climbed from  $213 million in 1954 to $603 million in 1959. In this expansion, rock and roll jumped from a 15.7 percent share of the pop market in 1955 to a 42.7 percent share in 1959. During the same time period, independent record companies went from a 21.6 percent share of the pop market in 1955 to a 66.3 percent share of a pop market that was roughly three times larger in 1959. Rock and roll was clearly a threat to established music business interests economically. But it was a threat to the whole society culturally and politically.

As a rhythm-dominant music that placed a high aesthetic value on repetition and improvisation, rock and roll represented a hybrid form that favored African ways of making music over European. As such, it created a space for African American artists in mainstream culture that had not previously existed. Further, as a music steeped in regional accents, slurred syllables, and urban slang, it foregrounded working-class sensibilities in opposition to elite notions of culture and Tin Pan Alley's white, middle-class orientation. Finally, it was the first music marketed directly to youth; its performers were roughly the same age as its audience. This, coupled with the rebellious tone of the music, created the first publicly identified generation gap in society at large.

Despite various efforts to tame the music in the late fifties, rock and roll became even more highly politicized in the 1960s, as baby boomers came of age and the music became identified with radical youth movements throughout the world. By this time the music associated with the "British Invasion," its name now shortened to "rock," had made a major contribution, elevating the music to the status of art, even as it became more closely linked with alternative and oppositional tendencies. A whole new broadcast medium—FM rock radio—and a burgeoning rock press opened up to accommodate these new sounds. But, just as the radical movements of the sixties depended in part on the affluence provided by imperialist practices, popular music was inextricably bound to the capitalist interests that produced it. "From the start," said Michael Lydon in 1970, "rock has been commercial in its very essence. . . . [I]t was never an art form that just happened to make money, nor a commercial undertaking that sometimes became art. Its art was synonymous with its business."[^30]

The 1960s may have been experienced by artists and audiences as a period of political awakening and cultural development, but for the music industry it was a period of commercial expansion and corporate consolidation. Far from disappearing, as the activists of the 1960s would have had it, capitalism simply became hipper. There was a new wisdom among corporate executives in the music industry. As it became clear that the key to profitability lay in manufacturing and distribution, record companies began contracting out most of the creative functions of music making. Far from resisting the creative impulses of offbeat artists or upstart independent labels, the major companies now signed acts directly, made label deals, entered into joint ventures, or contracted for distribution.

There ensued a period of unprecedented merger mania. Steve Chapple and I identified three types of mergers: horizontal, vertical, and conglomerate.[^31] In reality, of course, such ideal types were often hybrids as in the amalgamation of Warner-Reprise, Elektra-Asylum, and Atlantic in the creation of the Warner Communications empire. By the early 1970s a couple of dozen associated labels—in addition to extensive holdings in film and television, Mad magazine, sixty-three comic books, and a piece of Ms. magazine—were operating under the new corporate umbrella. CBS integrated vertically to control production and marketing from recording to retail sales. In addition to its own labels, recording studios, pressing plants, national distribution, and a publishing division, CBS, Inc. owned the Columbia Record and Tape Club, Pacific Stereo and the Discount Records chain, Fender Guitars, Leslie Speakers, Rhodes Pianos, and Rogers Drums. In Britain EMI had acquired an analogous set of holdings.

RCA, CBS, and EMI, which had purchased Capitol in 1955, had long been divisions of multinational electronics conglomerates. In the early 1970s they were joined by another electronics-related multinational corporation. Seimens and the Dutch conglomerate Philips had begun to merge their recording interests in the early sixties. In 1971 they combined to form PolyGram, which included MGM and Mercury. In 1980 they added British Decca. The structure of this multinational "Big Five"—four electrics giants plus Warner Communications—formed the basis for the new international music industry in the 1980s, as the business of music became an increasingly global phenomenon.

Meanwhile, the predominance of electronics firms in the music field created an issue, which seemed particularly antithetical to the prevailing ideology of popular music—namely, the connection between music and the military. Advances in electronic communication had always developed according to their military applications. It was no different in the sixties and seventies. The connection became apparent to the Rolling Stones when they discovered that their label had channeled profits from their records into precisely this kind of research and development. Said Keith Richard: "We found out . . . that all the bread we made for Decca was going into making little black boxes that go into American Air Force bombers to bomb fucking North Vietnam. . . . That was it. Goddamn, you find you've helped to kill God knows how many thousands of people without even knowing it. I'd rather the Mafia than Decca."[^32]

While popular music maintained a strong connection to the women's movement and the antinuclear movement throughout the 1970s, it was a time when the idealism of the sixties began to fade. Adding to the loss of innocence, it was here that the popular David and Goliath tale of small independent labels successfully challenging the majors for market share ended. While the indies may still have entered the business to fill a void in the market, their larger function became providing research and development for the majors. When Robert Stigwood's RSO label and Neil Bogart's Casablanca demonstrated from the bottom up that a fortune could be made in disco, PolyGram simply stepped in and acquired a controlling interest in both labels. Warner engineered a similar acquisition when Seymour Stein's Sire demonstrated the commercial potential of new wave. Far from being in competition with the majors, the independents had now become part of the same corporate web.

# Rock and Its Effects on National Cultures

As early as 1969, with only eleven countries providing data, IFPI reported that the revenues from the international sale of recorded music had surpassed  $2 billion. By 1978 the figure had jumped to more than $10 billion, with twenty-two countries reporting.[^33] The fact that three of the five international firms that shared more than 70 percent of this windfall—through subsidiaries, licensing, and/or distribution—were U.S.-owned (and a fourth, British) was cause for concern among many smaller nations around the world, who feared that their national cultures might be overrun.

Earlier in the century, Great Britain itself had experienced the problem. In 1949 Tin Pan Alley had made such an impact on Britain that only 19 percent of the music on the BBC was British. By 1958, at the height of early rock and roll, that figure had declined to 14.8 percent.[^34] In the rock explosion of the fifties and sixties, British and U.S. popular music were exported to every corner of the globe. As early as 1977 both CBS and RCA were reporting that more than 50 percent of their sales came from their international divisions.[^35] Even in developing countries, the British and U.S. popularity charts provided guidance for local licensees and radio stations regarding which international selections were worth releasing locally.

In this connection, Wallis and Malm noted that the 1970s were characterized by "the almost simultaneous emergence of what could be termed 'national pop and rock music'" in countries throughout the world.[^36] This included the adoption of electric instruments and related sound-amplification equipment. In this context, a general debate about culture dating from the sixties turned toward the question of cultural imperialism, particularly on the part of the United States, and to some extent Great Britain, as many nations became more involved in popular music. In Puerto Rico, for example, the rivalry between salseros and rockeros became so intense that it was often discussed as a referendum on national identity. Socialist countries, with a few notable exceptions such as the German Democratic Republic, tended toward the active suppression of Western popular music and rock-related styles in particular. In these instances rock was perceived as "the music of the enemy," consistent with the cultural imperialism thesis.

A closer look at the roots of rock, however, revealed a more complicated picture. Among its defining characteristics, European melodic and harmonic elements rested on a foundation of Africanisms—rhythm as an organizing principle, bent notes, syncopated phrasing, the call-and-response style—as well as a host of other influences as diverse as Latin American, French Creole, and Hawaiian.[^37] "It is difficult to argue, therefore," as Andrew Goodwin and Joe Gore pointed out, "that rock music is 'Western' in quite the same way that Hollywood cinema or British television news are."[^38] From this perspective, it would probably be more accurate to describe the emergence of popular West African genres such as Nigerian Afrobeat and Ghanaian Afro-rock as the culture of the African diaspora returning home, rather than a clear-cut instance of cultural imperialism.

Until this time, most governments and national elites tended to steer clear of the popular music sector, considering it to be a commercial product with little or no cultural value. If there were government policies at all, they were usually directed at preserving traditional musics or developing a national art music, which was usually a colonial vestige of European classical music. The developments of the 1970s caused many nations to reevaluate their policies toward popular music. Among the countries visited by Wallis and Malm, "Sweden and Denmark started to give grants to music groups playing national pop and rock. In Tunisia popular Arabic film music was introduced into government supported festivals as was calypso music in Trinidad, reggae music in Jamaica, Welsh-language rock music in Wales and, prior to 1973, neue cancion chilena in Chile. . . . A national pop and rock group, the Afro 70 group, with new electric and electronic instruments, represented Tanzania at FESTAC 77."[^39]

Unquestionably, the introduction of Western culture, technology, and organizational forms can exert a transformative influence on traditional cultures. The adoption of electric instruments and amplification can place financial strain on musicians. The establishment of a star system and the introduction of format radio can limit possibilities for exposure. Musics that have developed primarily in live performance and that serve ritual social functions can be packaged and sold to the world as entertainment.[^40] The issue, however, is whether or not such changes negate the use value of music. Roots reggae—a product of U.S. rhythm and blues, commercialization, Western technology, and Jamaicanento rhythms—can hardly be described as a music that has been stripped of its cultural power and political edge.

Technology is invariably a double-edged sword. In addition to adding to the coffers of multinational record companies, recording technology also provides small countries with a means of reproducing their own music. Cassette tape is a case in point. It was introduced by Philips in 1963, and later improvements provided the transnational music industry with an efficient format for expansion into remote areas. Cassettes became the preferred configuration for music reception internationally in the mid-eighties. However, precisely because the technology is portable and recordable, it has also been used in the production, duplication, and dissemination of local musics and in the creation of new musical styles. In this way the technology has tended to decentralize control over the production and consumption of music. Decentralized control holds out the possibility that new voices and new musics will find new avenues for expression.

It is important in this regard to consider the social relations of popular music, as distinct from those of other mass media. Most mass cultural products, such as film or video, are generally produced and manufactured in one country and sold as finished products in another. Popular music, on the other hand, is most often exported as a master tape, which is then manufactured locally.[^41] This encourages the development of a whole production and distribution infrastructure within the host country. In order to make their facilities cost-effective, multinational recording companies typically get involved in the production of local musics. The employees of the subsidiaries of multinational recording companies are most likely to be residents of the host country. The availability of production facilities, in turn, encourages the development of ancillary small businesses such as clubs and retail outlets, often owned and operated by local residents. With local mentors to turn to, indigenous artists become more aware of their rights and the value of their cultural products.

On a deeper, cultural level, and particularly in those countries with strong musical traditions of their own, there is an interaction between international pop and indigenous musics which simply doesn't exist with other mass cultural forms. "[T]he world had been flooded with Anglo-American music in the fifties and sixties," asserted Wallis and Malm. "This influenced but did not prevent local musicians from developing their own styles, adapted to their own cultures."[^42] While the connection between these musics and various rock styles is often obvious, each is also linked—by some combination of language, concrete references, instrumentation, and performance styles—to an indigenous culture. The results, at least as regards music, usually approximate what Wallis and Malm call "transculturation"—a two-way process whereby elements of international pop, rock, and rhythm and blues are incorporated into local and national musical cultures, and indigenous influences contribute to the development of new transnational styles.[^43]

In the early 1980s, the potential of this process might have been pushed to a new level, as advances in satellite transmission, which became apparent in the United States with the launching of MTV in 1981, created the possibility of instant national exposure for recording artists and the simultaneous broadcast of performances on a worldwide scale. On the international stage, the wonders of satellite transmission manifested themselves most dramatically in the phenomenon of mega-events—a series of socially conscious international concerts and all-star performances dubbed "charity rock"—that began in 1985 with Live Aid. Given its humanitarian impulse, charity rock provided a moment of opportunity, albeit a limited one, where internationalization itself was a two-way process. While British and American music was disproportionately broadcast to a worldwide audience, the international sounds of artists like Youssou N'Dour and Sly and Robbie also gained greater access to the world market.

The greater acceptance of artists from developing countries prompted the creation of new international marketing structures and promotional vehicles, as non-Western popular musics were incorporated into umbrella categories such as world music or world beat, for sale in industrialized nations. The transnational music industry could have taken this development as a glimpse into a more decentralized and culturally diverse future. But embracing such a vision would have required the industry to challenge some of its own restrictive patterns, such as privileging the English language as a precondition for success in the largest international markets. Instead, the major labels retreated into a formula mentality that pointed the way to a more limiting international culture.

# Globalization: Blockbusters, Superstars, and Revenue Streams

Like all capitalist enterprises, the transnational music industry tends toward expansion and concentration. But try as they might to manipulate the market, history has proven that it is seldom one they can predict or control. The triumph of rock and roll in the 1950s is a case in point. And while a handful of major corporations may rule financially, it is important to note that this is not synonymous with controlling the form, content, and style of popular music. The overwhelming success of hip-hop in the face of exclusion, suppression, and outright censorship is testament enough to that. If anything, record companies have relinquished control over form and content in their relentless pursuit of higher profits.

Beginning in the 1980s, the major companies embarked on a strategy that made production significantly more restrictive, making it harder for new artists to enter the business. The precipitating incident was a recession that hit the industry in the early 1980s. From an all-time high of $11.4 billion in 1980, the sales figures from IFPI's two dozen or so reporting countries declined some 18 percent to $9.4 billion in 1983. While recovery began in 1984, the industry as a whole did not fully return to its 1980 level until 1986.[^44] In an industry thought to be recession-proof, this was a seismic event; labels responded by laying off personnel, trimming artist rosters, and limiting the number of new releases. Between 1980 and 1986 CBS alone eliminated over 7,000 positions worldwide.[^45]

The runaway success of Michael Jackson's *Thriller* pointed the way to recovery. Released in 1983, *Thriller* went on to sell some 40 million units worldwide, generating an unprecedented seven Top Ten singles and a record twelve Grammy Awards in the process. For the major companies, this became the model for success. In the cost-cutting fever generated by the recession, major companies looked to reap greater rewards from fewer artists. If a single artist can move 40 million units, they reasoned, why shoulder the extra administrative, production, and marketing costs of 80 artists moving half a million units each? *Thriller* thus signaled an era of blockbuster LPs featuring a limited number of superstar artists as the solution to the industry's economic woes.

Over the next few years a significant proportion of music industry revenues were generated by a few dozen superstar artists; in addition to Michael Jackson, there were Lionel Richie, Madonna, Prince, Bruce Springsteen, Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, Wham!, Phil Collins, Steve Winwood, Huey Lewis and the News, the Pointer Sisters, Janet Jackson, Anita Baker, and a handful of others. A surprising number of the new superstars were black. This was perhaps the first hint that the greater cosmopolitanism of a world market might produce some changes in the complexion of popular music.

But if it looked like the industry had at least succeeded in becoming more inclusive of African Americans and women, one couldn't help but notice that the only artists outside the British-American axis of popular music who could rival these superstars in terms of sales and cultural impact—Bob Marley, U2, Abba—all sang in English. Even Julio Iglesias, at one point the best-selling artist in the world, had to sing in English to generate hits in the United States. This lesson was hardly wasted on Francophone artist Celine Dion, who made her bid for international stardom on the strength of her first all-English LP, Unison, and subsequently cemented her position with the cross-media blockbuster, Titanic.

It was at this point that the transnational music companies began to think of themselves more as exploiters of rights than producers of records. Their new mission was to develop as many "revenue streams" as possible. Music-television and cross-media marketing—particularly movie tie-ins—were crucial to this development. All of the above artists had music videos on MTV, many of which were also connected to first-run Hollywood films. The video promoted the movie. The movie sold the record. The label cashed in at every step. Advertising was also institutionalized as a source of revenue; the Beatles' "Revolution" sold sneakers just as Dylan's "The Times They Are A'Changin'" made an accounting firm that much hipper. The music industry had effectively harnessed all the technology and marketing tools at its disposal to create an international roster of superstars who were capable of generating unheard-of profits with less product.

As usual, technology—in this case the compact disc—played a key role in the industry's success story. The CD was introduced in the early 1980s simultaneously by Philips and Sony. In terms of sound quality, resistance to wear, and ease of use, the CD was far superior to the LP. While market penetration was slow at first, because of the added expenditure for new hardware, by 1988 worldwide unit sales of LPs and CDs were roughly on par. Because CDs were priced significantly higher than LPs (even though they cost no more to manufacture), purchases in the new configuration added millions to a label's bottom line. In 1986 "the sale of 53 million CDs generated almost as much income ( $930 million) as the 125 million LPs sold ( $983 million)."[^46] By the end of the decade, the LP had begun its descent into virtual extinction.

The introduction of the CD opened up yet another revenue stream for the major labels—back catalogue. Back catalogue had always been a valuable commodity, as hit records have often boosted sales on previous recordings as well. With the advent of compact discs in the mid-eighties, back catalogue took on an even greater significance as consumers began buying recordings they already owned in the new configuration. The success of reissued artist retrospectives as boxed sets rendered back catalogue even more valuable. By the early nineties, catalogue sales were estimated as high as 40 percent of all album sales, making back catalogue, for many top-selling artists, their most valuable asset.

As always, however, the technology cut both ways. The CD may have captured the market in terms of quality, but cassette tape, because of its greater versatility as a recordable medium, remained the preferred configuration, still outselling CDs two to one until the end of the decade. Cassette technology may have enabled the transnational music industry to penetrate remote corners of the globe, but it was also responsible for the industry's two main financial headaches of the 1980s—piracy and home taping.

In 1982 IFPI estimated piracy at 11 percent of the total market in the United States and Canada, 21 percent in Latin America, 30 percent in Africa, and 66 percent in Asia.[^47] The organization had begun to deal with the threat as early as 1971, when they convened the Phonograms Convention, which proposed a three-stage strategy to curb piracy. Stages I and II, which dealt with protecting the major and minor markets, respectively, had made significant progress by the early 1980s. For Stage III, aimed at pirates "mainly ... situated in the developing world," the genteel system of international conventions was put aside in favor of a more bare-knuckles approach, tying piracy to trade sanctions against the offending nation. By treating music as an "export industry," the more powerful record-producing nations used their economic and political weight to reign in piratical practices elsewhere.[^48] This strategy, it should be noted, presupposes an uneven flow of capital and cultural goods, in that developing countries would likely have neither a positive balance of trade in intellectual property nor the economic clout to resist the pressure of industrialized nations. As a result of this approach, musical copyright issues have increasingly been built into trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), the EC's Single European Market program, and the international General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

As regards home taping, IFPI argued that the decline in industry revenues during the recession was directly related to the rising sales of cassette tape recorders and blank tape. There was little hard evidence to support the claim. Nevertheless, IFPI initiated an international campaign to levy a tax on blank tape and equipment that could be used to compensate copyright holders for their loss of income. The industry was not monolithic on this issue. The economic self-interest of hardware manufacturers like Philips, Sony, and Matsushita, who were in the process of bringing digital audio tape (DAT) recorders to market, was quite at odds with that of record companies, who saw blank tape levies as another potential revenue stream. This tension sometimes played itself out among different divisions of the same firm (e.g., Sony, which bought CBS Records in 1988). The hardware manufacturers and record companies finally came to terms in the IFPIbrokered Athens Agreement of 1989. The resulting "memorandum of understanding" provided a blueprint for legislation like the U.S. Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, which imposes levies on digital audio-recording devices and media. The legislation mandates that record companies get 38 percent of the royalty pool, performers 26 percent, and writers and publishers 17 percent each, with the remainder divided among unfeatured musicians and vocalists.[^49]

While such legislation appears, at first glance, to confer some measure of recognition on performers (a first in the United States), it is limited in a number of respects. In the first place, only digital hardware and recordable media (i.e., DAT) were subject to the royalty initially. And since the Athens Agreement mandated that all digital recording devices would be equipped with Philips' digital Serial Copy Management System (SCMS), which permits only one digital copy of a digital recording, DAT never caught on as a consumer medium in Europe or the United States. Since the U.S. legislation also included provision for Congress to amend the law as needed to accommodate new technologies, however, it may yet become a significant source of industry revenue, as new configurations like recordable CDs (CD-R and CD-RW) take hold.

Although the rhetoric surrounding intellectual property and the logic of copyright often appears to support the struggling artist, in practice, the result is a very imprecise and uneven system. In the industrialized world, most copyright distribution formulas favor older, more established artists. In 1982, for example, a mere 12 percent of the PRS's 12,000 members shared 80 percent of the Society's earnings.[^50] In developing countries, the question of collecting royalties across national boundaries at all presents major problems and internal distribution to artists and writers is even more haphazard.

For all its complaining about lost revenues, the major music corporations quickly resumed a pattern of steady growth following the recession of the early eighties. By 1993 the IFPI family of nations reported $30 billion in worldwide sales. Given the reconfigurations of the global economy, however, full recovery did not come about without some profound structural changes in the ownership patterns of the transnational music industry. Record companies were being bought and sold in a speculative atmosphere that made the merger mania of the late 1960s pale by comparison. In 1988 MCA bought Motown for $60 million. A couple of years later PolyGram purchased A&M and Island for upwards of $300 million each. Then MCA shelled out $545 million for Geffen Records.

These huge recording combines were, in turn, bought out by larger multinational corporations. EMI Records remained a division of Thorn EMI (created in 1979), which also controlled Capitol, Virgin, Chrysalis, IRS, and Rhino, among others. The German publishing conglomerate Bertelsmann purchased RCA Records and its affiliated labels when the record division was dumped in the General Electric takeover of RCA. When Sony bought CBS Records (renamed Sony Music) in 1988 for $2 billion, it was the biggest record-company sale in the history of the industry. Those numbers were dwarfed in 1990 when Matsushita forked over $6.6 billion for MCA and its affiliated labels, only to resell the combined companies to Seagrams of Canada five years later. When all was said and done, only one of the Big Five transnational record companies—WEA (Warner/Elektra/Atlantic), a division of Time-Warner—remained in U.S. hands, and in 1991

Time-Warner entered a partnership agreement with Toshiba and C. Itoh to the tune of one billion U.S. dollars.

These new configurations clearly had implications for cultural representation. When Michael Jackson recorded *Thriller* in 1983, Epic Records was U.S.-owned. By the time *Dangerous* was released, the label had become a division of Japanese-owned Sony-CBS, which constructed not so much a supranational cultural identity as a global manufacturing and distribution network, ready to mass market anything that will sell internationally. Queried Simon Frith: "whose culture do Sony-CBS and BMG-RCA represent?"[^51]

Even though the world may have been poised to accept a rather broad range of musics pointing toward a more decentralized plan for artist development, the music industry did not alter its marketing strategies in the least. "Instead of investing in and nurturing a wide range of new talents," observed Anthony DeCurtis in 1992, "record companies are betting wildly like drunks at the roulette table, hoping that one big score—whether by an old favorite or a new lucky number—will cover all past debts."[^52] Ever since Thriller, the music industry has been stuck in a notion of artist development that demands superstardom. Consequently, record companies spent the early nineties ponying up millions for contracts that were as unprecedented as they were unrecoverable.

When Janet Jackson switched from A&M to Virgin in 1991, with only two albums (albeit both number 1) to her credit, she scored a reported S30-million deal. Virgin chairman Richard Branson compared the signing to buying a Rembrandt. Columbia's Don Jenner described Mariah Carey's platinum debut more crassly. "We don't look at Mariah Carey as a dance-pop artist," said Jenner. "We look at her as a franchise."[^53] Aerosmith inked a new deal with Columbia in 1991 worth upwards of  $30 million. That same year, Motley Crue reupped with Elektra for a $25-million guarantee. ZZ Top scored $30 million at RCA. The Rolling Stones topped them with a $40-million, three-album deal at Virgin. And even these contracts couldn't compete with the deals offered to Madonna, Michael Jackson, and Prince (by then known simply as The Artist), each of which were reportedly worth more than $60 million in guarantees.

Interestingly, the biggest superstars failed to sell like superstars. Pearl Jam outsold Michael Jackson. New releases by Madonna and The Artist rose and fell on the charts as never before. The Artist sustained himself with three greatest-hits packages; Madonna with a fifty-dollar "art" book of revealing photographs of herself called Sex. But instead of learning from these lessons, in 1996 Warner signed R.E.M. to a five-album, $80-million deal, the largest contract in record-company history.

# Into the New Millennium

On the eve of the new millennium, corporate shuffling continued unabated. The unexpected demerger of Thorn EMI set the music division afloat, creating a prime target for acquisition. In 1998 Seagrams combined the holdings of MCA (acquired from Matsushita in 1995) and PolyGram (purchased for $10.4 billion) into a single corporate entity called, modestly enough, the Universal Music Group. Among the labels that UMG controls are MCA, Universal (formerly PolyGram), Geffen, A&M, Motown, Island, Mercury, London, and Interscope. The new mega-firm operates in forty-eight countries and boasts a market share (extrapolating from combined 1997 figures of both corporations) of 23 percent. This kind of merger represents a significant level of concentration in the music industry. The downside, of course, is that as many as 20 percent of the company's 15,500 employees could be fired and literally hundreds of bands could be dropped from its artist roster.[^54] No matter. While waiting for the next Michael Jackson to come along, the company will be able to sustain itself on the exploitation of catalogue from its more than forty wholly owned publishing offices.

In this regard, it is interesting to note that corporate capital has expanded its hold over intellectual property rights in at least three critical areas: extending the term of copyright, narrowing the arena for fair use, and creating brand-new intellectual property rights. In the 1990s both the European Community and the United States extended the term of copyright to a point that effectively eliminates the public domain for music written in the twentieth century. In a sweeping revision designed to bring the United States in line with changes in the European Community dating back to 1993, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 extended U.S. copyrights owned by corporations to ninety-five years and individually held copyrights to the life of the author plus seventy years. While the move was spearheaded by Disney because, under the existing law, Mickey Mouse was about to enter the public domain, such legislation obviously serves the interests of transnational capital, which is becoming better organized on an administrative level.

One of the main avenues through which the international music industry currently seeks to protect its interests is the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), established in 1970 and currently representing 171 member nations. WIPO is charged with developing treaties for protecting the rights of intellectual property owners. These agreements are, in turn, codified in national legislation such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 in the United States, which makes it illegal to circumvent technological measures for protecting sound recordings and other copyrighted material. Seemingly in the interest of creative artists, such measures compel us to revisit the diminishing terrain of fair use. "If data can be protected by code—and it's illegal to break the code," argues Robert J. Samuelson, "then 'fair use' for anything that arrives digitally may vanish."[^55]

Extending the reach of corporations even further, the most recent WIPO treaty calls for the creation of a completely new intellectual property right to protect the owners of electronic databases. "The general objective of this right," according to the treaty, "is to protect the investment of time, money, and effort by the maker of a database, irrespective of whether the database is in itself innovative."[^56] Depending on how narrowly the treaty is implemented, it may not only be illegal to duplicate a record, it may also be illegal to quote its chart position without permission.

Ironically, it may be the double blade of the technology that makes all of this possible which cuts into corporate control once again. Just as cassettes issued a challenge to centralized control in the seventies and eighties, newer technologies such as the MPEG 1—Audio Layer 3 (MP3) software compression format provides near-CD-quality, downloadable audio over the Internet. MP3 dates back to a 1987 collaboration between Germany's Fraunhofer Institut Integrierte Schaltungen and Dieter Seitzer from the University of Erlangen, whose work yielded a compression/decompression algorithm, or codec, that could shrink sound files to about one-tenth their normal size without sacrificing quality. In 1992 MP3 was approved as a standard by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), founded by Leonardo Chariglioni in Italy. But it wasn't until modem and computer clock speeds permitted efficient downloads of MP3 files that the technology threatened to turn the music industry on its head. By the late nineties music enthusiasts—indeed, artists themselves—were converting audio CD files to MP3 and posting them on websites for easy, and most often unauthorized, download. Since that time the term "MP3" has become second only to the word "sex" as the most requested item on Internet search engines.

Technologies like MP3 are threatening to the music industry for a number of reasons. In the first place, MP3 holds out the possibility of a business model that links artists directly with consumers, bypassing the record companies completely. And with articulate industry critics like Chuck D and forward-looking artists like Sheryl Crow already on board, MP3 is generating a momentum that the industry can ill afford to ignore. According to Wired magazine: "About 846 million new CDs were sold last year. But at least 17 million MP3 files are downloaded from the Net each day. That adds up to almost 3 billion in the first six months of 1999."[^57] As a result electronic distribution sites like MP3.com and online record labels like Atomic Pop, new home to such artists as Public Enemy and Ice-T, are challenging the status quo.

More upsetting from the industry point of view is the fact that MP3 is an unprotected format, which leaves the industry with no way to regulate its use. Desktop MP3 players such as MacAMP and Winamp (since purchased by America OnLine) have proliferated, enabling users to download and listen to MP3 files on their computers. They have become so successful that MP3 has attracted mainstream computer-industry giants like Microsoft and RealNetworks, who introduced the Windows Media Player and the RealJukebox, respectively, the latter of which was downloaded one million times within ten days of its launch.

It was the introduction of Diamond Multimedia's Rio, a portable MP3 player that moved MP3 beyond the computer desktop, which really caused the industry to stand up and take notice. The Rio is a walkman-like digital player, with no SCMS copy-protection chip, capable of downloading, storing, and playing back 60 minutes of MP3 music. Fearing piracy on a grand scale, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) was quick to bring suit, claiming a violation of the Audio Home Recording Act. Diamond, however, squeezed through a loophole by successfully arguing that the legislation targeted only recording devices and the Rio was a storage device. With the injunction quashed, other portable MP3 players were rushed to market, including Creative Labs' Nomad, Pontis' MPlayer3, and Empeg's Empeg Car, which can hold up to 5,000 songs.

Taking a more proactive stance, the international music industry, as represented by the RIAA, the Recording Industry Association of Japan, IFPI, and the Big Five recording companies, proposed the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI), an open standard that would encode a sound file with a digital "watermark" identifying its owner and origin, as a way of discouraging piracy on the Internet. Interestingly, the person the industry tapped to head up the SDMI project was none other than Leonardo Chariglioni, the founder of MPEG, who certified MP3 in the first place.

With well over 100 organizations participating, SDMI required an enormous amount of collaboration. At the same time, record companies were feeling the pressure to have a commercially viable online presence by the 1999 holiday season, whether it was standardized or not. As a result, individual record companies began making independent deals to advance their own online interests. Universal Music Group and Bertelsman launched GetMusic.com using the Liquid Audio Player for downloading. Free-floating EMI also chose to work with Liquid Audio for secure downloads. Sony formed an alliance with Microsoft using their Media Player software and, together with Warner, merged their jointly owned Columbia House Record Club with the online retail outlet CD Now.

As of this writing, the industry is far from implementing standardized security protocols that work, and new technologies like MP3 show no signs of abatement. While transnational music corporations scramble to protect their bottom lines on new fronts, artists and fans may, at least momentarily, gain some measure of direct access to each other and to sound reproduction possibilities that are becoming increasingly harder to control.

From 1942 to 1944, eight million V-discs, representing some 400 recordings of more than 640 artists, were distributed. Donating their time and music for free, artists from rival record labels, who might otherwise have been prohibited from recording together for contractual reasons, created a number of "once-in-a-l lifetime" sessions for the V-disc program. V-discs were particularly valuable in that they were the only recordings that were permitted during the AFM strike of 1942. To discourage personal gain from this enterprise, most of the V-discs were recalled and destroyed after the war.
