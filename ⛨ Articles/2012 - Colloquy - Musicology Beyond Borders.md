North American musicology appears to be in a period of giddy expansionism. In 2011, the program committee for the annual meeting of the American Musicological Society (AMS) increased the acceptance rate for papers from 25 to 30 percent (programming 192 papers over 144 the year before), and the board welcomed nine study groups: a rapid recent proliferation since the original creation of the LGBTQ and “Hispanic” (subsequently Ibero-American Music) study groups in 1991 and 1993 respectively. As a result of these developments, the annual meeting ran nine sessions simultaneously that year. At the

business meeting, treasurer James Ladewig celebrated the society's net assets of \(4,369,498, and the editor of this Journal, Annegret Fauser, announced that the number of articles in each issue would increase. Presenters celebrated the society's musical and intellectual diversity (one might say "multiculturalism"), and pointed toward recent articles that extend the geographical and genre reach of the discipline beyond its traditional borders or push toward greater interdisciplinarity.\(^{1}\) Sitting there in the business meeting listening, I wondered whether a utopian era of boundless intellectual possibility was now really upon us. Is North American musicology poised to take on the world?

Perhaps not, because at the very moment when dramatic expansion of the discipline seems imminent, North American musicology is also showing visible signs of shutting down. Anybody who is on the job market or cares about people who are knows how frightening the situation appears to have become: drastic recent cuts at the University of California, University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Florida—to name just a few examples—point toward a shift in priorities in public education in the United States that is having dire consequences for how musicologists—and scholars across the humanities for that matter—will be able to do business and thrive into the twenty-first century. Standards are also declining as academic publishers outsource and cut corners on everything from copyediting to typesetting. As the economy collapses, a nostalgia for familiar borders grips the discipline: music-history textbooks insist on nineteenth-century national frameworks in spite of global advances, brilliant scholars choose to work within the geopolitical confines of the Cold War, and minority groups establish their voices in ghettoized study groups that are now incorporated into the AMS rather than functioning as a challenge to its status quo. In a recent article in the New York Times on the celebrations for Richard Taruskin at Princeton, James R. Oestreich hinted at the fierceness of this retrenchment by reporting on how Karol Berger described musicology at that conference as “drowning in a flood of ever-new products of an industry paralyzed by an inability to discriminate among them,” only to be countered by Susan McClary championing the inroads made by “the barbarians at the gates: women, gay people, Africans, and Asians.” More noteworthy than the radicalness of each of their positions (if reported correctly) was their willingness to resurrect an impenetrable wall between what is inside and outside musicology.[2]

The paradox of simultaneous expansion and contraction in musicology eerily mirrors the inner dynamic of neoliberal, global capitalism. Recently, Nick Vaughan-Williams and others have examined this dynamic from the per

spective of Limology or Border Studies. Vaughan-Williams describes how before the fall of the Berlin wall, scholars studied borders primarily from empirical and critical geopolitical perspectives as located at a fixed point at the geographical outer edge of sovereign states, the power of which they delimited and whose citizens they identified and defined. Since 1989, however, global policies, decremented border administrations, and the disjuncture between territorial and juridical limits have led to a shift from geo- to biopolitics (a term associated with both Georgio Agamben and Michel Foucault). The internal borders between nation states in the European Union (EU) were gradually abolished with the Schengen Agreement (1985) and Amsterdam Treaty (1997), leading to the European Council's creation of Frontex in 2004 as an agency for "integrated border security" for the entire EU. At the same time, the UK Border Act of 2007 allowed the Secretary of State to require biometric passports for non-EU immigrants and asylum seekers. These actions freed up movement within the EU and UK, while making entry into both more difficult and ultimately life-threatening for some. They facilitated the movements of "easy" travelers and limited that of "risk" travellers, creating the paradox of simultaneous expansion and contraction noted above. Further, starting in 2002, the United States government exerted a legal control beyond territory boundaries by claiming it could torture detainees in Guantanamo specifically because they were not on US soil. In these cases, government officials did not erase borders to create an unlimited global context of empire, but rather reinforced borders on the basis of the biometric data recorded in travelers' passports.

Vaughan-Williams's work convinced me that rather than euphorically celebrate metaphorical cultural border crossings, it might be time for musicologists to turn their attention to the material reality of borders themselves and the violence they perpetuate.3 Why is the old geopolitical, cultural border of "Western Europe" so firmly ensconced in musicology (as the border to be crossed), in spite of the fact that it has long been replaced by the heavily policed and guarded political and economic entity of the EU? And how can musicologists expand their discipline to include music from countries all over the world, while still insisting on their disciplinary and methodological distinction from their colleagues in Ethnomusicology—for example, through the separation of their national societies in North America and through standard university processes of hiring and teaching? Is the desire for global border crossings a form of imperial nostalgia? Or a way of denying the fact of having to live in a walled fortress (the US, UK, or EU, for example) that includes or excludes people based on their biopolitical data? Or is it a sign of what Lauren Berlant calls "cruel optimism"—a relation of attachment to the compromised conditions of possibility of "the good life" promised by liberal capitalism in the

postwar period?4 Have threats to the humanities and to the prestige, privilege, and power of tenured academics in North America caused musicologists there to go into denial about their situation, and to prefer escaping into the chimera of an expanding discipline over the harsh reality of having to interrogate and perhaps dismantle and reorganize the material borders that have historically secured their position? Can musicologists really integrate Mexico into “U.S. Music Studies” while ignoring the physical barriers recently erected to prevent intellectual and physical mobility in the other direction and the draconian measures that have led to tragic loss of life on the US-Mexican border?5 If they do so, are they not expanding the domain of North American musicological law and method beyond the territory in which it is historically valid, just as the US government has done in Guantanamo?

Vaughan-Williams responds to the moral dilemmas created by the violent shift from geo- to biopolitics by seeking "alternate border imaginaries" and new political concepts adequate to these contemporary conditions. Drawing on critiques of sovereignty and borders offered by Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida, Carl Schmitt, Foucault, Agamben, and others, he reminds us that the modern sovereign territorial state was founded in violence (in a moment when laws were created out of non-laws) and that violence is fundamental to its juridical-political order. Violence occurs when law-making and law-perpetuating functions merge, as they do with the police, whose spectral force is most potent when borders are established and in the border regions. In Agamben's terms, the sovereign decides which life is worth living, condemning those who don't fulfill their terms to an existence he controversially describes as "bare life"—a "zone of indistinction" represented by the concentration camp and by Guantanamo.<sup>6</sup> Vaughan-Williams concludes that these borders and zones are exceptional places—states of exception in Carl Schmitt's sense—"scars in the territorial landscape that act as reminders of 'the sufferings, the crimes, the tortures' that rarely fail to accompany the founding of states as distinct entities." Resistance will occur in these very border regions, he insists, in places where the boundary between the inside and outside of the state is blurred, where refugees and those who don't identify in a community dwell, and where lines and borders cannot be drawn.<sup>7</sup> His political appeal resonates with Walter D. Mignolo's call for "border thinking" or "alternative centers of enunciation," a "thinking from" the margins made possible by the reestablishment of colonial difference.<sup>8</sup>

What might a musicology that dwelled in the border look like? I don't think it would consist of situating oneself in a violent border zone and there continuing the musicological business of collecting sounds of resistance as musicologist Janie Cole and former oil trader Nancy Galdy propose to do in their project "Music Beyond Borders." And surely it would not consist of representing border issues—or creating border listening regions through aesthetic forms with broad commercial appeal and cult status—in the academy. On the contrary, I think that if musicologists want to operate in the border they will need to become acutely aware of the material reality of the borders against which they chafe, and be willing to confront in their scholarship the explosive violence that will emerge if they interrogate truly the power relations all borders sustain and reinforce. They will need to recognize the difference between North American musicological tourists' metaphorical fantasies of global freedom and the concrete reality of what Emily Apter theorizes as the "checkpoint," which regulates traffic of people and goods and, in David A. Fleni and Karim Matter's interpretation, enacts relations of power through rituals of crossing in which language and translation become matters of life and death. Rather than adopting the familiar mode of anti-imperialist resistance once practiced by new musicologists now incorporated into the discipline, musicologists in the borders would need to seek new forms of political activism, perhaps by imagining themselves to be in a permanent state of exception or to be intellectual refugees. The musicology in the borders they would create might resemble what Suzanne Cusick has done in researching musical torture in Guantanamo. It would surely not be celebratory, and probably impossible to sustain without collapsing the discipline and creating it anew.

# What Inclusiveness Excludes

# ERIC DROTT

As Tamara Levitz argues in her introduction to this colloquy, musicology is increasingly troubled by the question of its borders. Recent decades have witnessed a sustained effort to broaden musicology's purview, both in terms of the musics it addresses and the interdisciplinary perspectives it countenances. In contrast to this expansionary impulse stands the countervailing tendency to retreat in the face of perceived threats to musicology's self-identity, the better

to safeguard repertoires and methods at risk of being washed away by a flood of musical and disciplinary others. As Levitz makes clear, each response to the problem of musicology's limits has its shortcomings. The one replicates the logic of late capitalism, with its unending quest to find new market niches to exploit, while the other seeks solace in familiar constructs like the work concept and the canon. But it also needs to be acknowledged that each response has its allures. Even if musicology's "giddy expansionism" is symptomatic of the way neoliberal values have infected academic work, it has the benefit of remedying the discipline's many historic sins of omission. And even if a retreat to well-trodden terrain is inadequate to the challenges presented by shifting social realities, it nevertheless bespeaks a latent desire to resist precisely those pressures that neoliberal capitalism exercises on musicological research and musical life more generally.

If current responses to musicology's border troubles prove unsatisfactory—be it the impulse to surmount existing frontiers or to crouch defensively behind them—then perhaps a more fruitful way forward would be to train our attention on the figure of the border itself. Levitz offers one model in this regard, reminding us of the violence that the establishment and enforcement of any determinate frontier necessarily entails. But this is not the only model. Over the past decade, a number of scholars have offered sustained critiques of the boundaries that musicology imposes upon the musical field in constituting its objects of study. Gary Tomlinson, for one, has sketched the historical process by which European music was discursively segregated from its extra-European counterparts, an act of demarcation that enabled musicology to claim for western art music the mantle of a spurious universality.[14] Along similar lines, Georgina Born has recently emphasized the way in which individual music cultures are defined in terms of what they exclude, by the "constitutive outside" generated as a result of expelling some disavowed other(s).[15] More recently still, George Lewis has argued for a deterritorialization of Americanist musicology, noting how a category like American music can be and often is "articulated far beyond America's shores," thus blurring the hard-and-fast divisions characteristic of the discipline's geographical imagination.[16] The critical interventions undertaken by Tomlinson, Born, and Lewis, their manifest differences notwithstanding, all bespeak a change in the basic unit of musicological analysis: the focus is no longer on individual music traditions, but on their interaction and interpenetration. This in turn presupposes the adoption of a totalizing vantage point, one that is capable of encompassing cultural difference without effacing it, as well as disclosing the constructedness of boundaries too often taken as given. Whence Tomlinson's call for a "sweeping neo-comparativism," which would resituate musicology within the framework

14. Tomlinson, "Musicology, Anthropology, History."  
15. Born, "For a Relational Musicology," 217.  
16. Lewis, "Americanist Musicology," 692.

of “a general ethnomusicology.”<sup>17</sup> Or Born's call to institute a “relational musicology,” whose expansive vision would sidestep the discipline's dogged belief “that research on music must be founded on aesthetic advocacy of the music to be studied.”<sup>18</sup> Or Lewis's call for a “nomadic musicology,” which would reject “a comparative, border-drawing methodology” to account for “the permanence of permeability” and “the transience of borders.”<sup>19</sup>

More than anything else, the reflexive interrogation of musicology's border politics has the benefit of bringing to light the exclusions that have long underpinned our scholarly activities. But by the same token the disciplinary reorientation entailed by this line of inquiry risks fostering a belief that the particular form of self-awareness thus achieved is tantamount to self-awareness tout court. Despite the obvious merit of such approaches in relation to the narrowly conceived musicology of yesteryear, the notion that a neocomparativist, relational, or nomadic musicology should point the way forward for music studies must also be held up for scrutiny. What uninterrogated assumptions animate the injunction to adopt the kind of expansive, totalizing view that these approaches presuppose? What is the "constitutive outside" of a research paradigm that seeks to reveal how the lines separating inside and outside are drawn in the first place? In short, what might be excluded by the inclusive perspective that a critical reflection on musicology's borders demands?

Some insight into these questions may be gained by considering how forms of cultural distinction have evolved in recent decades, and by contemplating how they resonate with the values embodied by critiques of musicology's limits. As research in the sociology of taste over the past twenty years has indicated, the exclusivity that has long been a hallmark of legitimate cultural practice (and which still informs everyday conceptions of cultural elitism) has itself been progressively delegitimized, supplanted by strategies that rely upon displays of eclecticism and openness to mark individuals' social position.[20] This "omnivorous" posture does not stigmatize specific repertoires or practices as déclassé; rather it treats them, along with their more "respectable" counterparts, as potential ingredients in a singular and singularly distinctive cultural mix, one that presumes and effectively signals a high level of educational attainment, untrammeled access to cultural goods, and command over the time and resources necessary to master a variety of social and aesthetic codes.

Subsequent research in this area has moved away from the simplistic and in many respects pernicious model that sets "highbrow" omnivores above and against "lowbrow" univores, taking into account the fact that engagement with diverse cultural practices may be observed across social groups, irrespective of occupational category, educational attainment, ethnicity, or gender

(though age correlates strongly with the diversity of one's tastes, with younger cohorts more likely to partake of a broader palette of cultural offerings than older ones).21 In an era when digital media and the Internet have lowered the barriers to cultural consumption, what matters less is the quantitative breadth of individuals' cultural repertoires than its qualitative composition, with preference for classical music and other artforms traditionally coded as "high" still tracing a subtle yet significant symbolic boundary. Not all forms of cultural eclecticism are the same; nor are all treated equally. Also significant is the precise manner in which actors both deploy and construe the wide-ranging cultural repertoires they engage.22 Is breadth of taste conceived in terms of a high-minded desire for self-improvement to be achieved through exposure to diverse aesthetic experiences? Or is it figured as a kind of diversity by default, a result of one's inability to discriminate between different genres and artistic codes? What is above all crucial to observe about recent mutations in practices of cultural distinction is how displays of aesthetic openness turn the virtue of inclusiveness into a means of symbolic exclusion, as individuals' comportment vis-à-vis cultural difference—along with the specific habitus that such comportment implies—becomes the basis for the formation of in-groups and outgroups. In this regard, new modes of cultural distinction bear much in common with stances occupying homologous positions in contemporary civic discourse, namely those that extol the virtues of tolerance and cosmopolitanism. As Wendy Brown observes, discourses of tolerance typically presuppose a hegemonic liberal subject who has mastered and thereby transcended cultural attachments. Such discourses divide the world into two broad groups, "those who are said to be ruled by culture" and "those who are said to rule themselves but enjoy culture."23 Similarly, Craig Calhoun notes that appeals to cosmopolitanism—understood as a curative for the ills of ethnocentrism—devalue what are characterized as narrow, parochial attachments, and hence "disempower those who lack substantial personal or organizational resources." The problem, Calhoun remarks, is that "would-be cosmopolitans don't recognize the extent to which cosmopolitan appreciation of global diversity is based on privileges of wealth and perhaps especially citizenship in certain states."24

Lurking behind the foregoing is the issue of class, a topic that has come back into public view after many years of hiding in plain sight. Indeed, in a recent colloquy published in this Journal, Gayle Sherwood Magee called on her fellow Americanists to pay greater attention to how this oft-neglected deter

minant shapes musical practice—an appeal I whole-heartedly endorse.[25] But, as Magee intimates, it will not suffice to simply incorporate the music(s) ascribed to this or that class into the list of repertoires we address through our teaching or research, or to revise our disciplinary borders so as to integrate this category into the set of determinants that our scholarship must henceforth take into consideration. For such gestures, however justifiable or well intentioned, are themselves implicated in the dynamics of class. Musicologists, after all, are classed subjects—not just on account of our diverse “class origins,” whatever they may be, but more importantly on account of the way we are socialized into the academy, the particular kind of work we perform within its institutional confines, and the functions such work fulfills within the larger social division of labor. Furthermore, one consequence of this work, whether we like it or not, involves the formation of other classed subjects: not so much by what we communicate explicitly to students and colleagues, but what we convey implicitly, by the kind of relationships we exhibit with regard to certain cultural practices, the kind of familiarity we evince with some musics as opposed to others, and the subtle, unconscious value judgments we express, even when we are striving to remain value-neutral.

But the main reason care must be taken when incorporating class into our disciplinary remit is that doing so unthinkingly, without accounting for our own entanglement in its snares, risks reproducing contemporary forms of class-based distinction. Similar risks are courted by injunctions to institute a "relational" or "neocomparativist" musicology, to say nothing of efforts at reconstructing the field along more expansive lines. Even though I am convinced of the necessity of such initiatives, and even though I have tried to put them into practice in my own work on music and politics in France, I cannot help but suspect that they are driven by more than an empiricist desire to address the reality of musical difference, or a politico-ethical imperative to redress the troubling exclusions that hitherto defined musicology. Rather, calls to interrogate boundaries and disrupt hierarchies, far from exorcising the specter of "aesthetic advocacy," are themselves redolent of a particular set of aesthetic values, a certain taste culture, one indexed to those social positions in possession of the resources necessary to range freely across social, cultural, and artistic regimes. Unless the reflexive consideration of musicology's borders is prepared to acknowledge this fact—that the inclusive, totalizing view of the musical field it advances originates from a particular location in social space, embodying the values and interests associated with this position—it threatens to entrench new boundaries and erect new hierarchies, even as it calls existing ones to account.

# Working on the Boundaries: Translation Studies, National Narratives, and Robert Lachmann in Jerusalem

# BRIGID COHEN

During a time when historical musicology is expanding its subject matter and geographical purview, it is all the more important to theorize cultural crossings carefully, reckoning with the ideological boundaries that have historically defined the discipline. I suggest here how one such set of foundational limitations—musicology's reliance on national models of history—can be illuminated and challenged through a sustained engagement with the growing field of translation studies. To animate this point, I turn to a particular historical episode: the comparative musicologist Robert Lachmann's boundary-crossing pedagogical activities in Mandate Palestine, set against the hotly contested nationalist movements of that era.

In a recent JAMS colloquy, Alejandro Madrid reminded readers of musicology's "ideological foundations . . . in the project of state building." These foundations, he suggests, have been increasingly put under pressure by a history of "transnational musical flows."[26] If the discipline of musicology originated in the need to tell the history of nations and their cultures, then many of its traditional norms (especially in studies of nineteenth- and twentieth-century contexts) seem at once well suited to this aim and resistant to the sustained examination of cultural boundary-crossings in all their complexity. I would take these nation-centered tendencies to include: (1) the elaboration of artistic lineages (often, though not always, suggesting national schools and styles); (2) the identification of "central" figures and phenomena within relatively unified ideas of "society" or a "public sphere" (often implicitly equated with a national civic space); and (3) the tracing of relationships between bounded cultural categories (whether these categories are defined by nation, by ideas of Western vs. non-Western culture, or by other signs of demarcation). While a burgeoning interest in transnational musical networks increasingly challenges these norms, it is striking the extent to which the "deep structures" of nation-centered historiography persist, even within many studies of musical migration.[27] As literary scholar Emily Apter notes, "National character ghosts theories and approaches even in this era of anti-essentialism."[28]

In this context, translation studies has emerged as a vital "interdiscipline"—engaging fields from comparative literature to anthropology to media studies to law—because it foregrounds dilemmas of cultural plurality (rather than the nation's unity) and displacement (rather than impermeable boundaries).

Historically, translation studies emerged as a subdiscipline within literary scholarship pertaining to the practice and theory of literary translation. Yet, in recent decades, developments within this field have attracted a timely and energetic dialogue among disciplines about conditions of cross-cultural encounter.[29] This exchange has centered on the "gap" between an original text in a source language and its translation in a target language—a split that evokes dilemmas of cultural transmission more generally. As Walter Benjamin argued, translation is a task that points to the impossibility of easy transfer across boundaries (or simple equivalency between disparate languages), while also insisting on the necessity of this difficult transfer for the survival of cultural texts and practices.[30] The impossibility of simple transfer—the insurmountable gap between different media or languages—ultimately brings "newness into the world."[31] In other words, translation theory since Benjamin focuses on translation not as a space of loss (implicitly positioning translations as inferior to their originals), but rather as a space of contingency and transmutation necessary to the afterlives of cultural practices. At the same time, recent theorists have seen translation as far from politically benign or neutral, but inextricably bound up in power dynamics with often profound material consequences.[32] Such insights prove relevant to many cultural practices beyond translation in its strict literary sense. For the purposes of this essay, translation studies suggest modes of historical continuance that benefit from cultural crossings and their unpredictable play of difference, thus opening historiographical alternatives that better model diasporic experience and other cultural exchanges than do the familiar nation-centered narratives. Moreover, "translation" works as a provocative concept-metaphor that draws attention to musical practices that depend upon similar "gaps" between media (through transcription, recording, etc.), which also make possible cultural transmission and change.

A translational turn in historical musicology would bring together the discipline's long-standing historiographical emphases with an intensified focus on cultural exchange more commonly articulated in ethnomusicology. As such, the turn toward translation studies would bring theoretical depth to the growing interests in transnational cultural networks and media studies that have taken hold in the field. It would also enrich and gesture beyond traditional studies of musical exoticism, foregrounding networks of power far more complicated than the standard unidirectional accounts of "centralized" Western appropriations of "peripheral" non-Western sources that have long organized their focus.

To explore such translational possibilities in concrete terms, let us consider the case of Lachmann in Jerusalem, which has received some valuable scholarly attention but calls out for more.[33] Having lost his appointment at the Berlin Staatsbibliothek when the Nazis seized power in 1933, Lachmann was invited by Hebrew University president Judah Magnes to found the Phonogram Archive for Oriental Music in association with the university in 1935. After immigrating to Jerusalem, Lachmann worked as a steady proponent for cross-cultural music education in the Yishuv and in Arab institutions of learning. The following words, drawn from a quasi-Socratic dialogue in an unpublished manuscript, exemplify his advocacy of this project:

A. Is it desirable to have an Arab section [of music taught in schools] considering that European music represents a higher stage of musical development?  
B. We must not consider Eur. and Arab music as representing different stages in the same line of development. We must rather think of them as different kinds of music, each having gone through centuries of development and capable of further development. There is a fundamental difference between European music and Oriental music (of which Arab music is a branch), but both have the same right to exist.[34]

Though Lachmann had long made similar arguments before his exile, this document is distinguished by its place within an unprecedented field of pedagogical practice in Palestine.[35] In 1937, Lachmann began to use the recorded musics of the Archive as a basis for classes in cross-cultural music education for secondary-level students in Arabic- and Hebrew-language schools. In a moment of candor, he justified his work in terms of a broad aspiration for improving cross-cultural understanding in the Middle East: "My work necessitates free intercourse with all the different ethnical groups in this country and the Near East generally. It may therefore be made to contribute, however modestly, towards aims beyond its immediate scope, towards a better understanding between Jews and Arabs."[36] Lachmann was supported by a network of individuals joined together by the technologies of the Phonogram Archive: technicians and assistants (most notably, Edith Gerson-Kiwi) alongside musicians and other research associates (including oud virtuoso Ezra Aharon). By 1937, Lachmann suggested to Magnes that he would need to share directorship of the Archive with an Arab scholar in order to bring cultural credibility and a greater knowledge base to the Archive in the context of its work outside the university.[37]

Lachmann's projects generally fit within a wider pacifist Zionist agenda associated with Brith Shalom. This society was founded in 1928 as a loose-knit organization—centered in Jerusalem and associated with such thinkers as Magnes himself, Martin Buber, and Arthur Ruppin—that sought to establish Jewish-Arab cultural understanding as the primary goal of the Yishuv.[38] They tended to advocate founding an Arab-Jewish binational federation in the region as an alternative to a Jewish-majority nation-state. This "post-national" vision drew on many ideas, ranging from socialism to Habsburg-inspired models. Although Brith Shalom's political influence fell into steep decline in the 1930s—in the shadow of the Holocaust, the 1936-39 Arab Revolt, and the attendant rise of militarized nationalisms—educational projects remained at the core of its proponents' mission.

Lachmann's practice in Jerusalem can be described as translational on more levels than can adequately be explored within the space of this essay. Most notably, the Phonogram Archive was a laboratory that, as Bruno Latour has argued of laboratories in general, performed a "translational" function.[39] In other words, laboratories need not be thought of as merely expanding knowledge of familiar entities, but rather as transforming the relations and significance of those entities by breaking down boundaries (or "translating") between "in-house" and wider social spaces. In keeping with this, I wish to focus on the Archive as a lever for social change—an approach that contrasts with the trope of cultural conservation that has often been used to describe Lachmann's work as a comparative musicologist. Like a scientific laboratory, the Archive worked to isolate and transfer unwieldy, complex elements (musical material, knowledge, and sources) from a broad social field into a space for intensive analysis, supported by specific and powerful technologies (phonograph recording, written transcription, and archival collection). Once Lachmann and his associates had transferred and interpreted musical objects of study within the Archive, they made a complimentary translational move outward again, using the knowledge gained in the Archive to leverage educational projects in the "outside" world. To be sure, the "translational" power dynamics that shaped Lachmann's activities were far more complicated than this basic laboratory model would suggest, especially given the wider contexts of the Mandate's colonial setting, Lachmann's and his associates' exile conditions, power dynamics within Hebrew University, and the funding networks linking Lachmann's work with donor circles in the United States. Yet translation studies offers the conceptual models that would illuminate such power relations, while spotlighting the productive "gaps" that helped to constitute the Archive's space of creativity: gaps in the communications among European-Jewish scholars, Mizrahi immigrants, Palestinian Arab musicians, and other actors in the Archive; between cultural contexts of performance and

media of recording and transcription; among Lachmann's research priorities, the institutional aims of Hebrew University, and the agendas of Brith Shalom; and so on.

There is plenty at stake in the reappraisal of such translational episodes, especially given their place (or non-place or partial place) within consequential national histories. Lachmann's Archive underwent over fifty years of neglect after his 1939 death. Since its restoration in the early 1990s, Lachmann has been recognized retrospectively as having established "the material basis for ethnomusicology in the modern state of Israel."[40] Yet no scholarship has yet examined or explicitly acknowledged the Archive's relationship to the cultural-political agenda of Brith Shalom.[41] This lacuna surely results from the impulse to rehabilitate Lachmann within an implicitly national narrative, which jars with that organization's agonistic relationship with the very idea of the nation-state as a primary basis for political community. Yet such lacunae increasingly call out for redress, not only in the case of Israeli history (which throws into relief questions of plurality and state-building so vividly), but also in those of every other nation or community characterized by similar dilemmas of diversity at its very foundations.

# "Reinventar" la musicaología para América Latina?

The leading Cuban musicologist Victoria Eli Rodriguez wrote this entry in Spanish, reflecting in it on a seminal essay on the discipline of musicology that she wrote in 1998.42 We have included both the original Spanish and, following this, Tamara Levitz's English translation, in order to raise the question of linguistic borders and make the act of translation transparent.

compartimentos al uso, me permitoayar como centro de mi participationla necessities que tiene la musicaología latinoamericana de repensar en sus fronteras e incluso modifieras.

De todos es conocido que la escisión existente sobre todo entre musicaología historérica y etnomusicología que se ha desarrollado en la practicia musicaológica de cuyo europeo y en las instituciones académicas norteamericanas ha tenido repercisión en el ambito@científico y académico latinoamericano, en la medida que una buena parte de los profesionales de estas ramas en el continente se han formado durante mucho tiempo en las universidades extranjeras y preferentemente en las norteamericanas. Resulta muy fácil y complejodeojar a un bajo esta "tradicción" cuando vivimos en sociétades muy estratificadas y donde aun perviven los valores y las posiciones neocolonialistas.

Pero las preguntas en el momento actual son, entre otheras: Los criterios estéticos y los canones formales y musicales impuestos o heredados de la “músicología occidental” son adecuados al estudio las realidades latinoamericanas? Debe el musicólogo latinoamericano mantenerlos o deben desprenderse de ellos? Las fronteras, marcadas por la academia, europea o norteamericana, resultan pertinentes para el estudio de las culturas musicales de América Latina?

Como he escrito en 1998, “las culturas musicales latinoamericanas se muestran como una compleja trama que, al partir del novelista y música cólogo cubano Alejo Carpentier, ‘hay que acceptarla en bloque, tal como es, admitiendose que sus más originales expresiones lo mesmo puedaEARle de la calle comovenirle de las academias.’”43 “Es asi que al打架ar la música esta,anteceder particuliar ha de hacerlo desdeuna posicón de analisis del amplio sistemas de relaciones que la cultura musical posee,onde el objerto nogue circunscribirse al estudio del lllamado ‘arte musicalculo’ [privilegiando el texto, definiendo modelos y patrones], con el fin de poder al descubierto o racionalizar los elementos o medios expresivos que han sido puestos en practica y contrastarlos con los canones tomados o impuestos pororas culturas. Tampoco ha de proponerse, de forma aislada,el estudio de losodos de hacer que se han conservado y modificado en differentes comunidades—en general en graves conditiones de subdesarrollo-y para thispartir de los postulados teoricos y metodologicos de other disciplina: la etnomusicología.”44

El pasado 19 de mayo, el musicólogo mexicano-norteamericano Alejandro L. Madrid en sus palabras de inauguración del XIII Premio de Musicología Casa de las Américas en La Habana, SIGNALaba que “la presente crisis académica, social y presupuestal global es precisamente uno de los momentos en que la música y sus instituciones necesitan reinventarse. Sin embargo, esta reinversión no pueda ceder ante los modelos utilizarios que pretenden definir a las

humanidades desdefuera;debeseruna transformacionque identificuycritique losmodelosideológicosque la musicaologíahaayudadoa reproducir."45

En este procesourgente y necessario de reinvencion musicologica no es possible la exclusion de personas,;pueblos y repertorios y retomar viejos criterios-aún presentes entre algunos intelectuales-de segregacion de las culturas Latinoamérica y oposicion deellas a una cultura occidental "superior" y hegemónica, oasar por alto las politicas esgrimas por los "paises del primer mundo" en relation con las conditiones historicas deOthers territorios implicados hoy dia en enfrentamenti de diversa indole.En momentos de crisis,embargos economicos y guerras fratricidas se han visto involucrados enormes perdidas de valiosas vidas humanas, asi como la destruccion irreversible de patrimonios culturales y artisticos de las naciones y de la humanidad.

En medio de un panorama historico tan complejo, elusicólogo latino-americano tiene ante si "la vivencia y la espontaneidad del hecho folclórico en medio de la variabilidad y la mutabilidad que les son propias,+junto a una música popular urbana que se proyecta con fuerza a工程技术 de la industry cultural y los medios de difusión, y una valiosa música académica que no ha sido muy favorecida en los circuitos internaciones de conciento. Estas esferas lejos de excluirse se interrelaciónan en eldeenir historico musical del continente y han sido decisivas en la definiccion de las identidades de los@músicos Latinoamericanos. Para hacer possible la explicacion de estas interinfluencias y el estudio de la música como medio para perfilar新品as realidades, se requiree de un instrumento metodico y teorico que permita un analisis de forma integral,queletes a un lado las rigideces esquemáticas que no pueda concebirse hoy en medio del quehacer scientifico."46 Ha de someterse a juicescriticos el aparato conceptual "construido" y "probado," por la musicologia y la etnomusicología europea y norteamericana, e ir a la seleccion de aquello que resulte util haciendo las modifications que la situacion historica y cultural de America Latina exigande.

El valor inestimable que pueda alcantar la ciencia musicaológica latinoamericana actual—e incluyo a la musicologia en su Conjunto—está en su “papel aglutinador de disciplinas afines, en el parceter activo que ha de asumir acortando las distancias que la分开ar de otherciencias sociales, sin aislar el hecho musical en todas sus especialidades como lenguaje de la funcionalidad social que le es intrinsca.”[47] Sin embargo no ha de perdarse de vista, y retomo las recientesPALabras de Alejandro Madrid,que “vivimos un tiempo de crisis economica, social e ideologica a nivel global; se tratate de uncontexto de capitalismo desbocado en el que las humanidades se han visto atacadas de una manera inusual por no encajjar en el modelo utiliser que el capital transnacional nos impone.”[48]

# "Reinventing" Musicology for Latin America?

# VICTORIA ELI RODRIGUEZ

Translated by Tamara Levitz50

Above all I would like to thank Tamara Levitz for her invitation to participate in this colloquy. The proposed topic, as it relates to defining the object of study and epistemological conceptualization of the discipline of musicology, has emerged at different times in history, and taken on degrees of contemporary relevance that vary with historical circumstance, as is the case today. Rather than offer a history of how music scholars have been defining, compartmentalizing, and dividing the field of music studies in the last more than one hundred years—of how they have divided it, for example, into historical, systematic, and theoretical musicology or comparative musicology; or into historical musicology versus ethnomusicology or the anthropology of music, as well as into the new denominations related to particular fields of study such as popular music studies and musicology and gender, and many other subdisciplines, all of which try to expand or transcend the usual compartmentalization of the discipline—I will concentrate in my response on the need to rethink and possibly modify the borders of Latin American musicology.

Everybody knows that the existing split between historical musicology and ethnomusicology, which developed as a consequence of an essentially European musicological practice and in North American academic institutions, had

a great impact on the Latin American scientific and academic community inasmuch as a large number of professionals in these disciplines on the [South American] continent were trained for many years in foreign and preferably North American universities. It would be difficult and complex to cast aside this "tradition" when we are still living in highly stratified societies in which neocolonial values and perspectives still operate.

And yet in the current climate questions arise, among them: Are the aesthetic criteria and formal and musical canons imposed or inherited from "Western musicology" adequate for the study of Latin American realities? Should the Latin American musicologist maintain or abandon them? Are the borders determined by the European and North American academy pertinent to the study of musical cultures in Latin America?

[As I wrote in 1998], "Latin American musical cultures present a complex picture, which, in the words of the novelist and musicologist Alejo Carpentier, 'has to be accepted en bloc, as it is, by admitting that the most original expressions of that culture can emerge from the street as well as from the academies.'"51 [Again, as I wrote then]: "To confront this particular reality, musicologists have to analyze [Latin American] musical culture's broad system of relations. They cannot limit their object of study to so-called art music [privileging the text and defining models and patterns], with the goal of exposing and rationalizing elements and expressive means put into practice by the composer and contrasting them with canons taken from or imposed by other cultures. Neither can they suggest studying in an isolated fashion the creative means that have been conserved and modified in different, usually gravely underdeveloped communities, and to this aim depart from theoretical and methodological premises of another discipline: Ethnomusicology."52

On 19 March 2012, the Mexican-North American musicologist Alejandro L. Madrid indicated in his inaugural speech for the Thirteenth Musicological Prize of the Casa de las Américas [at the Seventh International Musicological Conference] in Havana that "the current academic, social, and global budgetary crisis offers precisely one of those moments in which musicology and its institutions must reinvent themselves. Those reinventing the discipline cannot succumb to utilitarian models that define the Humanities from the outside, however: rather, they must identify and critique ideological models that the discipline itself has contributed to reproducing."[53]

As we engage in this project of the urgent and necessary reinvention of musicology, it will not be possible for us to exclude persons, peoples, and repertoires, or for us to take up again old criteria—still circulating among certain

intellectuals—for segregating Latin American cultures and opposing them to a “superior,” hegemonic Western culture. It will also not be possible for us to overlook the politics of “First World countries” in relation to the historic conditions of territories implicated today in confrontations of various kinds. In moments of crisis, economic embargo, and fratricidal conflict we have witnessed enormous loss of valuable human life, as well as the irreversible destruction of cultural and artistic heritage of the world’s nations and humanity.

Working within such a complex historical panorama, the Latin American musicologist has to negotiate, [as I said in a modified form in 1998], "folkloric events in light of their variability and mutability, popular urban music disseminated through the cultural industry and advertising media, and academic music that has not received much support on the international concert stage. These spheres, far from excluding each other, have been interrelated in the development of music history on the [South American] continent and have been decisive in defining the identities of Latin American musicians. In order to explain the reciprocal influences of these musics and the study of music as a means of outlining new realities, we need a methodological and theoretical apparatus that will allow us to analyze the situation in an integral way."54 We need an apparatus that will allow us to cast aside rigid schemes that are no longer viable in light of the scientific task at hand. We need to judge critically the conceptual apparatus "constructed" and "proven" by European and North American musicologists, and need to seek a conceptual apparatus that proves useful in making the modifications required by the historical and cultural situation of Latin America.

[I still believe today, as I did in 1998], that the invaluable contribution of contemporary Latin American musicology, and musicology on the whole, lies in its role as the “glue that binds together related disciplines, and in the active role it plays in bridging the gap that separates it from the other social sciences, yet without isolating music in all its specificity as a language from the social functions intrinsic to it.”[55] Nevertheless we cannot forget, and here I quote again Alejandro L. Madrid, that “we live in a time of global economic, social, and ideological crisis, [and that] we are dealing with a context of unbridled capitalism, in which the Humanities have come under unusual attack for not fitting into the utilitarian model imposed by transnational capital.”[56]

This reflection on borders in musicology leads to the formulation of new questions and considerations amidst a set of crossing axes that draw together the local, regional, and national, and that promote the definition of identities superimposed on the Latin American scene—identities that, on the one hand, seek to recognize and affirm each other in themselves, and that, on the other, compare and distinguish themselves in opposition to other cultures.

[I would still conclude, as I did in 1998], that the basis of a solid discipline of Latin American musicology lies in "elaborating theoretical premises for the investigation and analysis of music in all its different modes of production," and also in engaging more intensely with "sociological and psychological aspects of musical creation and consumption," and, I would add today, with economic and administrative factors that the global cultural industry demands and with structural aspects of the social function of music that are being constantly modified by the increased migratory flows brought on by the international situation.[57]

# Borderline Subjects, Musical Objects

# RYAN DOHONEY

Borders are queer things. They mark where home is. They give a measure of comfort by securing for us a habitable space. They are, however, not given. Borders are established through struggle.[58] Often hard-won, they need to be defended as they protect our home, not that of another. Borders are agonistic sites of contestation and, as such, are provisional and relational. I will respond to Tamara Levitz's provocations by considering music's role in maintaining and reconfiguring borders between self and other, and thus in what Isabelle Stengers has called "productions of subjectivity"—practices through which we sense ourselves and our place in the world.[59] I am interested in particular in border drawings and crossings as they occur in the relational dynamics of musical experience.

A growing number of musicologists are studying the relationship between musical experience and subject formation. Naomi Cumming, Benjamin Piekut, and Antoine Hennion have all proffered approaches for analyzing how subjective borders are marked and reconfigured through sound production.[60] Cumming makes a convincing case for the importance of music in the construction of a "sonic self" or a particular musical being composed out of a network of social and affective relations. Hennion notes that our attachments (musical and otherwise) in many ways constitute our sense of self and mark us off from what we are not. Piekut, in a similar vein, argues that "every musical performance is the performance of a relationship."[61] Rather than reinscribe Enlightenment notions of sovereign selfhood in the productions of subjectivity they document, these scholars track the construction of selves out of un-

stable attachments that are constantly in flux. "Like a live wire, the subject channels what's going on around it in the process of its own self-composition," Kathleen Stewart writes, "it's a thing composed of encounters and the spaces and events it traverses and inhabits."[62] We traverse and inhabit sonic borders in the most sublime and mundane of our musical experiences. Sound rubs up against what we think we feel and how we live. A sound can change us, and force us to do something we didn't expect to do.

Carolyn Abbate recognizes music's capacity to participate in the formation of subjectivity when she discusses music's drastic abilities to reconfigure our perceptions and the kinds of stories we tell about them. In the rush to critique Abbate's work, we have foreclosed productive paths for the drastic, which I would reinterpret as a peculiar musical affect marking different kinds of border crossings and reconfigurations that invite our attention and documentation-- instead of reducing us to silence. Through her "autobiographical tidbits" Abbate conveys her sense of the affective flow and perceptual reconfiguration that occur during particularly intense live performances. I am most interested in her discussion of the possibilities in attending to the "neurological misfire" that accompanies drastic experience, which leads to uncertainty and confusion in response to music.[63] Abbate restricts the drastic by privileging its production during live performance, however. Yet the type of "presence" she celebrates occurs as well when human beings confront technologies and nonhuman objects. The relationships of which music is made are not only between people but also between people and things.[64] As Hennion notes, music "cumulates intermediaries, interpreters, instruments, mediums, all needed for its presence in the musical milieu."[65] Listening to any performance or recording is to partake in an experience distended in space and time and mediated by musicians, playback systems, instruments, and both physical and virtual bodies.

It was a rather mundane activity that got me thinking along these lines. In early 2012 I indulged in my penchant for thrift-store shopping in downtown Portland, Oregon. I wandered into a Goodwill boutique, a well-curated and

My reinterpretation of "the drastic" (one might say deliberate misreading) is in sympathy with James Hepokoski's critique of Vladimir Jankélevitch: "While not discounting the directness of music's impact as performed—which must remain an elemental reality for any considered reflection—one might still ask the counter-Jankélevitchian question of whether one ever approaches the captivating force of music in an unmediated way, as an isolated and independent subject emancipated from external constraints, free to recognize on one's own terms the ineffability believed to be really there"; Hepokoski, "Ineffable Immersion," 230.

miniaturized version of the more familiar thrift stores planted in strip malls across the country. I made my way past some costume jewelry and mintz to the small men's section hoping to find a tie or some other professorial garb. The soundscape of the store, as is often the case in retail environments, was not intrusively apparent.[66] The music encouraged evenly hovering attention to shopping, the task at hand. The selection of Top 40 hits from the 1980s and 1990s gave me a sense of, if not comfort, at least familiarity and allowed me to feel sonically at home. This soundscape was not necessarily conducive to intense experience, and yet something drastic did happen when "Take My Breath Away"—a song written by Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock and performed by the band Berlin—started to sound from the speakers.

"Take My Breath Away" is familiar to those who have seen the film Top Gun from 1987, in which it accompanies a rather tame love scene between Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis. As the song began to play, two shoppers at the Goodwill appeared deeply affected by it. They stopped what they were doing, mouthed the words in silent karaoke, and stared up at the speakers. I noticed their sudden shift in bodily attitude: they appeared captured by the song and held in momentary reverie. After several moments of immersion (lasting the length of the first verse and chorus) they began to shuttle back and forth between two observable modes of listening: at certain moments they treated the song as background music to their shopping, while at others they abandoned themselves to spontaneous flashes of sonic absorption. Although the shoppers may have appeared to be going inward in their moments of reverie, or setting up a border between themselves and the outside world by creating a fantasy of being sonically separate from it, they were in fact redrawing their connections rather dramatically by focusing acute attention on the technological apparatus (the speakers) that was enabling their drastic experience. Because I observed the changes in the shoppers but didn't feel the experience myself, I had some trouble empathizing with it. I kept wondering, "What is going on?" I am not sure that I have gotten it right. There is something in this experience that reminds me of Raymond Williams's "structures of feeling"—which describes intensities of feeling that are felt before they can be narrated.[67] Such affects are "changes of presence" that "do not have to await definition, classification, or rationalization before they can exert palpable pressure and set effective limits on experience and action."[68] If we open up Abbate's definition of the drastic, we begin to understand that it describes not a blank moment of pure listening, but rather a chain of relationships established between subjects and objects as they enter social and technological networks they did not foresee.[69]

69. Abbate is not alone in idealizing liveness and physical copresence. See my critique of philosopher Adriana Cavarero along these lines in Dohoney, "Antidote to Metaphysics."

What makes my autobiographical tidbit of interest to border thinking is that it gives evidence of how listening experiences divert our attention and profoundly affect our sense of self. David Hesmondhalgh questions whether music's role in the production of itselfhood is always positive, however. He argues that contemporary modes of listening such as those I've described above exemplify a form of musical subjectivity particular to neoliberal capitalism. Drawing on the work of sociologists Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, Hesmondhalgh describes this subjectivity as "connexionist": "the self is an individual enterprise, and transitory relationships and commitments are considered more legitimate than stable ones because rapidly changing one's connections can supposedly lead to personal growth and greater self-realization," he writes.[70] Many current technologies—Facebook, for example—dramatize and visualize our hyperconnected selves; others like Spotify integrate social networks with musical tastes resulting in a visualized real-time display of our listening practices.

The Goodwill scene above is no less technologically mediated. Music exerted power over the shoppers by reorienting their attention to a technological apparatus and created a sense of presence and immediacy that drew them away from their daily, mundane tasks. This story demonstrates that something happens to us when we're in the world listening. We become reoriented and affected, brought into dialogue with memories, technologies, emotions, and practices that alter our borders and wrap us up in experiences that we may not be able to name or describe terribly well. Recognizing these boundary situations and finding ways to articulate how they function will go a long way toward achieving an understanding of theaurality of contemporary life. As Hesmondhagh, Hennion, and Georgina Born agree, music's ability to blur or maintain borders influences both our daily lives and our scholarly work. Thus, more and more, it seems urgent that we attend to the ways in which we are being made and remade by sound. And yet many of us shy away from reflexively considering how we listen because we fear that our reflections will sound too personal or subjective. This reticence may lead us, as Gary Tomlinson wrote eloquently nearly two decades ago, to fall short in the ethical task of attending to "the immense complexity of the historian's dialogue with past subjectivities."71 I believe that we are at a crucial juncture and that we need to reassess the terms of our historical dialogues lest the border between musicology and matters of worldly concern become permanently impermeable. Given the state of the discipline as described by Levitz, we might well wonder where we stand in terms of our own subjective agency. Are the borders we tear down

# Musicology on the Edge: Reflections on Medieval Borders

# EMMA DILLON

This contribution offers observations about the border of the most enduring, and frequently contested, territories of the discipline, namely, the medieval border of the Western musical tradition: the edge that marks the beginning of music history. For decades, it has been the starting point of staple undergraduate history surveys; and in its most recent narration, Richard Taruskin's *History of Western Music*, the "curtain goes up" with the earliest notated traditions, beginning with Gregorian chant. Furthermore, by virtue of its roots in nineteenth-century philological methodologies, the study of medieval repertories marks another border: the beginnings of the field of musicology itself. The continuous presence of the medieval border thus makes it a prime witness to the topic of this colloquy, capable of speaking not only to the question of what constitutes a disciplinary border, but also of the complicated and changing history of borders within musicology. During its long lifespan, it has witnessed expansions and contractions, and, like the larger territory it demarcates, it has been construed as only marginally relevant and restrictively dominant by turns. Yet throughout all these formations and reformations, one constant remains: the seemingly unassailable endurance of the medieval border, manifest in the continuous practice of medieval-music studies in the mix of musicologies past and present. My purpose is not to rehearse the reasons for its ongoing presence, or that of the historical territory it frames; nor is it to defend, depose, or map the current position of the tradition, even though these possibilities remain pressing in many quarters. Instead, I will explore what place the practice of medieval borders may have in the border musicologies imagined by Tamara Levitz and other contributors. Specifically, the case of medieval borders illuminates questions pertinent to Levitz's consideration of contemporary directions of our field: what is the place of historical musicology in a musicology attuned to contemporary geopolitical borders, what might it contribute to, and learn from, these emerging initiatives? Pressing here is another, more challenging question: can, or indeed should, the historian or historically inclined participate in a future musicology in the border, a musicology in which one that is acutely aware of the "material reality" and violence of today's borders?

Medieval musicology does not just mark a border of disciplinary history. It is unequivocally in the border: a space of in-between. We can thus understand the tag "medieval musicology" as a kind of abbreviation. Expanded, it opens out onto a compound or chain of hyphenated identities, whose baseline is the

triple-barrel of medieval musicology-musicology-medieval studies (the last of which itself is a contraction of multiple disciplines). I borrow the hyphenated model for expressing the interdisciplinary or relational nature of the field from a recent study by Jeffrey Jerome Cohen on "difficult middles" in medieval Britain, to propose a way of understanding the medieval border as a collective comprised of distinct disciplinary or institutional identities.[72] That hyphenated status derives from the multiple disciplinary origins from which its evidence and methodological, theoretical, and linguistic resources derive; and also from its varied audiences for publication and presentation. It reflects, too, the economies of academic and institutional affiliation. A medieval musicologist working in North America may typically hold membership to the American Musicological Society and the Medieval Academy of America, for starters. Institutional affiliations in Departments of Music will be as "musicologist" or "historical musicologist" alongside colleagues who identify as theorists or ethnomusicologists; some might have visiting rights and obligations to Medieval Studies programs.

The hyphenated category can draw attention to potentially boundary-shifting possibilities. For residence “in the border” can reveal a dissonance—between modern and medieval ontologies and taxonomies: that the study of medieval repertories can draw on so many disciplinary categories illuminates crucial differences between contemporary and medieval ideas of music. For example, the engagement of chant and liturgy by musicology, art and architectural history, and religious history, to name but a few, is symptomatic of the fact that chant is not so much a musical tradition, as it is a facet of devotion habits; meanwhile, the singing voice is “vox” according to the practice of words and grammar. Such cases exert a strain on the traditional limits of the medieval border, pointing to the possibility of other ways to demarcate the field. Indeed, closer scrutiny of where the medieval borderline was first instated exposes it not as an originary or absolute limit at all. Taruskin’s curtain goes up not on a beginning, but rather “in the middle”: mapped between literate and oral practices, between music practices that adapted more readily to a version of music that came later, and those that did not. Musicology pursued the path of literate traditions: “which not only made music history possible, but also to a large extent determined its path.”73 Persistent though the literacy narrative is, seen through the lens of borders, the extending of the hyphenated chain common in medieval musicology points to the increased desirability of shifting the border. Such a move indicates the possibility of a music before music became Music. Border awareness is thus a directive for different beginnings and alternative ontologies. While such border awareness encourages change from within, it can also influence conversations about taxonomies of

sound and music that ripple out far beyond the hyphenations of the medieval border. As more recent fields such as sound studies and performance studies grapple with musical ontologies, the example of the medieval border may serve as a historical and historiographical touchstone.

Borders and border theories obviously have a past, and if border thinking is to be embraced, a historically informed attitude seems desirable. Writers and artists of the Middle Ages offer many alternate models, prompting points of contact and contrast with contemporary borders. Borders, margins, and frames pervade many mediums, visible in the decorated margins of manuscripts or cacophony of glosses that encompass and critique revered texts. They articulate and comment upon divisions and relationships between systems of authority, geographical, racial, sexual, and religious difference to name but a few. To be in the border was often to be hybrid or monstrous; it was a space both dangerous and unsettling. Representations of geographical borders in the topographical tradition of maps offer a vivid exemplum. Figure 1, from a mid-thirteenth-century French Psalter, follows a common format, and the looming Christ-figure is a clear cue that the map's function is not to represent actual space so much as to express religious ideologies. To the East, rounding out the circular edge of the Jerusalem-dominated center, a neat border of the so-called monstrous races or marvelous people line up like a hyphenated chain of wonders, each of them expressing monstrosity through hybrid concatenations of human and animal bodies parts.[74] In their graphic challenge to orthodox category of the human, they express fear and wonder of the unknown.

Similar anxiety about hybridity permeates literary evidence of experiences of geographical and cultural territory. Here, I return to Cohen's use of the model of hyphenation in his study of self-identification by writers of mixed backgrounds in twelfth-century Britain. While hyphenation works well in modern parlance to express regional mixture (for instance, we might speak of "Anglo-Normans"), such systems, however, "have no counterpart in medieval terminology."[75] He goes on, explaining that "individuals of mixed ancestry tended instead to have multiple identities available to them. The son of an English mother and a Norman father might consider himself Norman when hobnobbing at court, English when celebrating the history of his native country."[76] Writers like Gerard of Wales attempted to reconcile dual origins, highlighting how difficult it was to do so "when no terminology exists to express a self that happens to be fabricated of grossly unequal parts."[77] The bodies in which such composites resided were irrefutably "difficult." Being neither one

nor the other, being both or all, was a disturbing place to be. Yet it was also in such spaces that issues of identity were at their most acute, and where transformation and revelation could occur, as Caroline Walker Bynum's work on metamorphosis and identity has shown.[78]

Within medieval studies, attention to such borders and border attitudes has spawned its own modern monsters—a scholarly community for whom cohabitation in the border is now commonplace. Michael Camille's now-classic 1992 Image on the Edge is a benchmark study of the margins of medieval art, whose broad audience is one instance of how border studies cut across old disciplinary boundaries. More recently, scholars such as Sharon Kinoshita, David Wallace, and Ardis Butterfield have challenged the way we construct place and language with regard medieval literary traditions, with far-reaching consequences for a remapping of the tradition.[79] Kinoshita's work, for instance, described as "medieval postcolonialism," relocates French literature of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in a geographical frame that widens territories of influence to include the Iberian peninsula and Eastern Mediterranean; her work takes account, too, of the economics and politics of cultural exchange in these regions. Such remappings have consequences, too, for the geography of medieval music, indeed for any form of cultural production in this period.

Let me return to the questions of this colloquy, and to what the foray into medieval borders suggests about the relationship of historical musicology to the formation of musicologies born of today's border realities. Scrutiny of institutional histories that account for border formation, and consideration of the evidence of border history itself, may certainly incite those active in borders of long standing to rethink "stock" narratives; and in redefining old borders, to make space for new territories. It may also serve new musicologies by offering deeper context for ontological and taxonomical formulations. But it is important, too, to mark a clear distinction between a historical borderism pursued in medieval-music studies, and the borderism Levitz asks us to contemplate, one explicitly connected to today's geopolitical realities. In keeping those distinctions active, we may need to resist models of comparison or analogy. Instead, perhaps the more valuable lesson of the medieval borderism I have sketched is what it says about being in the border in the academic practice of music studies today. For it seems that, as never before, we are all, always, in the border. Institutionally, we may live our scholarly hyphenations in singular, discrete units, or as connected messy chains. The latter, for which there is no real institutional terminology, let alone framework, is the harder, but also the more productive course of action. In this space we must admit to one another's monstrosity, but recognize, too, that however dangerous monsters may be, they are also sites of revelation and agents of change. In the border,

too, we might freely extend our hyphenations, guided by intellectual conviction more than disciplinary prescription. It is difficult work to occupy such a space, demanding of intensive labor to accumulate the expertise necessary to develop the monster categories; it is difficult work, too, to make sense of another's monstrous concoction. But being in this border is a different kind of labor, a different kind of difficult, to the borders evoked by Levitz and theorized by Vaughan-Williams and Agamben. To effect a structural shift within our borders has its own demands, and implications for institutional and intellectual infrastructures. Yet we may undertake such shifts working within institutional environments considerably less perilous than the borders with which many have to contend. These examples of musicology in the border may be yet far from the trajectories envisioned by Levitz—of musicological borders more violent and unsettling than are currently accommodated—but they come with an opportunity: now more than ever, to model a borderism that resists certain restrictive pasts of our field, and which in its monstrosity is determinedly counter to the violent space of so many of today's living borders.

# (De)Constructing Musicology's Borders along the Color Line MATTHEw D. MORRISON

Since attending my first national American Musicological Society conference in 2007 as an Eileen Southern Travel Fund recipient, I have witnessed a significant expansion in the boundaries of the discipline. Within this time, the society has, at its national meetings, held a Presidential Forum on Diversity sponsored by then president Charles M. Atkinson, and a special session on approaches to race and ethnicity sponsored by the Committee on Cultural Diversity.[80] Musicological journals have expanded to include a larger diversity of topics and authors. The AMS has recently supported monographs that push the discipline's subject matter, as well as its geographical and methodological borders. This JAMS colloquy, furthermore, suggests that the society is taking seriously the subject of how it polices and protects its own borders. Undoubtedly, North American musicology's growth within this short time is to be duly recognized. It seems as though we are at a place where we can now consider seriously the possibilities of the discipline expanding beyond its traditional borders and fields of inquiry.

Yet as I write this response, there is a certain reality that is impossible for me to ignore: my position as an African-American (henceforth "black") male PhD candidate in historical musicology. While I recognize that this is a position of privilege that allows me to imagine a space and discipline without borders, my almost singularity within the society forces me at the same time to reflect on both the protection and policing of these very borders that I—through my

scholarship and scholarly activism—seek to permeate.[81] Before musicologists can earnestly contemplate a “musicology beyond borders,” I think they must first address one of its most sustaining and complex components: race. An invisible color line is built into musicology’s institutional foundations, and it is this line that determines which subjects and people are considered worthy or unworthy of entry into the discipline. I hope to render this line visible so that it might be eradicated. Only when musicologists begin to question the structures that support the results of this eradication will they be able to welcome fully new approaches, topics, inquiries, and people into the discipline—leading to a state of what Levitz calls permanent “dwelling in the border.”

My desire to dismantle racial boundaries within the discipline must be seen from my own perspective as a racialized subject both within the academy and in society at large. Despite the hopes and dreams incited by the election of a black President in 2008, the tragedy is that both the discipline and the academy still function within the United States as a racial state. The (c)overt policing of the nation's geographical and institutional borders resembles that of borders within musicology. As a black male PhD student in musicology, I am constantly forced to reckon with the borders of race in my quotidian experiences, which are inseparable from my experiences within the elite, predominately white spaces of academia. Whether I am being racially profiled and "stopped and frisked" by police on the streets of New York City, or being made acutely aware of the lack of scholars of color and related topics at the society's national conference, both situations cause me to realize the importance of critiquing the construction and impact of race within musicology and its discourses in order to move beyond its limitations and borders.

# Considering the role of race in constructing musicology's current borders

In 2006, the AMS completed a demographic survey of its membership that appeared in the fall 2007 AMS newsletter.[82] According to the survey, 3,300 members were invited, and 2,250 members responded. From the data provided, the racial demographics reflected a discipline with an 85.97 percent white membership, with over half of the members between the ages of forty and sixty-nine. With only 9 percent of the membership identifying as nonwhite ethnicities, and only 1.33 percent identifying as black, a question raised by Ellie Hisama at the 2009 AMS conference in Philadelphia persistently rings in my ears: "Might the society's continued extreme lack of racial diversity in its ranks, faculty and graduate students alike, account partially for the relative lack

of attention to race in the profession?" This leads to another question one could ask in 2012: Is there even awareness that there is a "lack of attention" to race in the profession? As I delved into musicological texts in my early graduate studies through coursework and in preparation for general examinations, I became acutely aware that North American musicologists are little concerned with topics related to racialized subjects and virtually totally disinterested in critical approaches that consider race and its conceptual impact on music and sound. Early in my career, I wondered what many scholars of color have won- dered before me: could the lack of diversity influence my own feelings of scholarly and personal isolation within the discipline?83

I was encouraged by "diversity" panels at the AMS annual conferences in 2007 and 2009, but as I continued my studies, the persistence of "whiteness" within the discipline's membership and scholarship, in addition to the lack of large-scale efforts to change this situation, made me question whether musicology was the place for a black, male scholar of music. After experiencing my own musicological identity crisis, I looked for guidance to scholars of color within the discipline and to their work, as well as to other scholars sensitive to my unique position as a black musicologist. All of the people with whom I spoke noted that if I did not claim my position and if I deserted the discipline, my voice, as well as my unique identity, would be lost, and my individual experience would continue to be underrepresented within musicological discourse.

In order to assess more critically my own experience of and feelings about the discipline, I knew I had to test them against empirical data. How did my personal experience fit within the larger reality of the discipline? By completing some empirical surveys, I hoped to gain a fuller understanding of where North American musicologists currently stand in their attempts to expand the borders of the discipline through critical considerations of race and racialized subjects. Table 1 shows what percentage of various important mediums of musicological communication addressed racial/ethnic issues and/or racialized subjects in the past two years.[84] The sixteen pie charts in Figure 2 show these figures as percentages of the whole.

To take race seriously within the project of expanding the boundaries of the discipline would mean to document candidly, and raise consciousness about, the direct connection between the number of doctoral students completing dissertations on topics related to race and racialized subjects, the curriculum and exams of graduate students in musicology, the tenured professors available

83. See Hisama, "Review of Musicology and Difference"; Lewis, "Americanist Musicology"; McGinty, "Black Scholars on Black Music"; Ramsey, "Pot Liquor Principle"; and Southern, "Interview with James Standifer."  
84. While this study was focused on considerations of race/ethnicity and racialized subjects, similar demographic surveys of gender, class, and sexuality within the discipline would likely yield comparable results. I collected this data by defining as "race" articles, dissertations, talks, or books that focused on a racialized/ethnic and/or non-western subjects, or that contained sustained reflection on critical race theories. I used the sources shown in Table 1.

to advise topics on race, the editors of musicological and academic publications who encourage and regularly publish work on topics related to race, the committees selected to decide what subjects and methods will be presented at conferences and awarded further recognition, the members in elected positions within the society, and ultimately, the diversity of topics and people within musicology as a whole. The fairly low (although in some cases, increasing) percentages of racial/ethnic topics represented in Figure 2 suggest that more direct and active recruitment efforts are necessary to attract minority candidates to the (musicological) academy, thereby diversifying the pool of those who will develop the specialized knowledge necessary to considering sound and music, and who will be able to contribute to reconstructing the boundaries of the discipline. Recruitment would "kill two birds with one stone," in the sense that increased diversity in the discipline would lead to increased diversity in the objects of study and methodologies, and allow the discipline to become even more expansive as minority and majority scholars come into closer contact through daily interactions in the classroom and at society meetings, as well as through their written work. The potential of such an increase in minority representation and interaction could both imploDE and explode the borders of the discipline.

# Considering the future role of race in (re)structuring musicology's borders

The dynamic scholarly interaction that could potentially occur is aptly demonstrated by this very colloquy. Tamara Levitz's proposal to question the borders of musicology within the society's primary journal and Annegret Fauser's acceptance of such inquiries as editor reflects both a concern and awareness for

change within the discourse and society. Furthermore, Levitz's keen awareness as a scholar and former AMS program chair led her to factor race into this discussion, as well as to invite a musicologist whose individual experiences as a racialized person within the discipline might increase and expand the perspectives offered.[85]

Yet even as I am aware of the dialogue created by participating in this colloquy, I cannot ignore the fact that there are still only a handful of black (male) musicologists in the discipline—even fewer than in many other professions and disciplines. I cannot ignore the societal structures that make it difficult for minorities, particularly blacks and Latinos, to find themselves in musicological programs in the first place. I cannot ignore the feeling that a small group

85. Levitz, "Philadelphia Program Selection."

of people decide who and what constitutes the discipline and actively (or passively) protect its borders. I cannot ignore the urgent need to diversify the ranks of the discipline in an effort to further expand its borders.

If senior ethnomusicologist Jacqueline C. Djedje had not visited my weekly music seminar for majors as an undergraduate student at the Historically Black Institution, Morehouse College, it is possible that I would never have considered the prospect of pursuing any type of musicology as a profession. If my advisors had not encouraged me to attend the national AMS conference during my first year of graduate study, and to apply for the Eileen Southern travel fund, I would not have met minority and majority scholars and students sensitive to my unique position, and I might not have felt a commitment to remain in the discipline after attaining my Master's degree. If there had not been mentors in the field, particularly mentors of color, to encourage my work and pursuits within musicology, I ultimately might not have thought it necessary as editor-in-chief of Current Musicology to expand actively the borders of the discipline by devoting an entire special issue of the journal to sound, race, and performance.[86]

For musicology's borders to be expanded, those who have the power to expand the discipline into yet uncharted territory have an obligation to articulate—with resounding clarity—the relationship between individuals who choose to become a part of the discipline, musicologists at large, and the subject matter of musicological discourse. Only when greater consciousness is raised about the historic development and structural premises that result in the ethnic, gender, class, and racial demographics of the field will my voice, body, and inquiries operate less in or on the borders of the discipline and move into the center, creating unlimited potential for collective conversations, and for sharing with others an equally unlimited multitude of perspectives and methods.
