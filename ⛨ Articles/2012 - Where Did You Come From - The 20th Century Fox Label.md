# "Where Did You Come From": The 20th Century Fox Label

With the tremendous concern historically shown by formal discographers for the products of the 78 era, some latter day labels in dire need of attention have been overlooked. Web-based, amateur discographers and collector's publications have picked up the slack on some of this research, but it tends to be of variable quality and does not necessarily answer all of the burning questions one may have about a recording of relatively recent vintage once it comes into their possession. The 20th Century Fox label is a case in point; although its run ended less than a decade before the 20-year cutoff that ARSC uses to qualify a "historical" recording, its largely undocumented history stretches back into the late 1930s. The label's first incarnation is an orphan, and the remainder is neither a 'major' nor 'minor' but something in between. Author David Lewis aims to provide here a baseline study for these various products, includes for the first time in print a discography by David Diehl for the earliest 20th Century Fox label, and adds a 'reverse discography' for later releases, designed for comparison against an existing listing.

These days there is a tug-of-war over what constitutes a discography. Before the internet, the very term "discography" was mainly only known to discographers and writers who relied on research documents to support the arguments conducted in the non-fiction arena. To many in traditional discography, a true discography is nothing less than a listing of recordings as complete as possible and adhering in some way to the model of arrangement provided by the father of discography, the late Brian Rust. However, since the advent of the internet, a simple line listing of available CDs by an artist from an online vendor – replete with bad and duplicate entries – can be proffered as a "discography" even though it offers nothing near to the level of depth that is the accepted standard for traditional discography. This is a problem mostly for discographers; the vendors who ply such data under the moniker don't really care. They have to call the listing something, and to them "discography" suits it just as well as any other term out there; "web listing" just doesn't have the same panache.

One might propose that the same is true in regard to label histories. On one hand, sites such as bsnpubs.com and Wikipedia have done an admirable job in providing comprehensive platforms for label histories, although in the case of Wikipedia the platform is often there without any content, or with data of negligible quality. A particular pet peeve is that the ungrammatical term "sublabel" threatens to enter the discographical vocabulary, even though fully functional – and more accurate – terms such as "subsidiary," "label acquisition" and "imprint" have been in use for decades. The bsnpubs (aka Both Sides Now Publications) site<sup>1</sup> has some admirable histories of labels that were active during the era

of stereo LPs, but some articles are built on relatively little information. A good example is that for the 20th Century Fox label; not much better than the inaccurate Wikipedia article that is based on it. Both fail to mention Henry Onorati or Basil J. Bova, and both repeat the apparent fiction that at one time Dickie Goodman was the head of the company. Both articles tend to view the 78 era and pre-1972 20th Century Fox labels as being of little consequence. These have been bound together by a sham publisher in Germany to create a phony book, The 20th Century Fox Label.<sup>3</sup> What follows is a concise summary of this label's history both as a way of answering such challenges and to hopefully fill in some of the gaps on this significant label's history.

# 78-era Label (ca. 1938-1944)

The Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation began in 1935 when the ailing Fox Film Corporation merged with Darryl Zanuck's 20th Century Pictures. The production of movie musicals was very important in the early years of the 20th Century Fox studio; in addition to bringing in such musical talent as Ethel Merman and Benny Goodman, Shirley Temple, Betty Grable and Alice Faye were among the studio's biggest draws. 20th Century Fox began to produce small runs of shellac records of numbers recorded on their soundstages for promotional purposes. These records, with their typewritten labels, were given away for free to radio stations for use in advertising, to visitors to the studio, stars of the movies themselves, technical craftsmen on the lot and so on as a little perque for working there. During reorganization of studio property in the 1970s, a large number of these records were still present in the studio library, so they were given out to anyone willing to pick them up, according to Jack Casebolt, a collector and correspondent that made a pickup of such records exactly this way.

These 78-rpm 20th Century Fox records bore a plain white label, and are still occasionally seen in the collector's market. Although numbered, the only discographical listing that exists for them is the one created by David Diehl for his site The eDiscographer<sup>4</sup> in 2000, appended to this article with minor adjustments; the dates on films from which they are taken indicate that the records were made between 1938 and 1943. Also, some wholly non-commercial recordings were made for demonstration purposes on 20th Century Fox soundstages, such as a 1938 demo of the Raymond Scott Quintet performing "Celebration on the Planet Mars," a piece the group did not record commercially.<sup>5</sup> This suggests that Scott was not the only artist to use the soundstage at 20th Century Fox that way, though no other examples are known. After ending this program, 20th Century Fox did not start another label until 1958, although licensing soundtracks to other, established labels was an important source of revenue for their music department. Ironically, the 1958 start up of the 20th Century Fox label meant that the work of the music director universally regarded as their greatest, Alfred Newman (1910-1970), was represented by only one title in the 20th Century Fox catalogue, "The Diary of Anne Frank," as Newman retired from the studio in 1960, working on a free-lance basis thereafter.

David Diehl's eDiscographer webpage also contributes information about a Fox Movietone label from the early 1930s that re-released records from other labels. This label existed before the merger of Fox and 20th Century Pictures, so it is outside the scope of this study. Movietone also briefly produced some sound-on-disc records for talking motion pictures around 1929-30; some of these have recently turned up on eBay.

# The Henry Onorati Era (1958-1962)

A fully public 20th Century Fox record label didn't get underway until April of 1958, when it was started under the supervision of Henry Onorati (1912-1993), who answered to studio vice-president Spyros Skouras. Onorati had been hired away from Randy Wood's Dot Records, where he had worked in A&R and promotions. Although the music division of 20th Century Fox had long licensed the music from the studio's films to other record companies for release, by this time it was no longer possible to ignore the enormous commercial success of albums such as Decca's Around the World in 80 Days, made from a 20th Century Fox studio property. Onorati announced that the 20th Fox label, as it was then called, would maintain a limited release schedule, issue blockbuster movie soundtracks in deluxe packages and focus mainly, but not exclusively, on releases tied into properties developed by the studio's film and television interests.[6]

Nevertheless, 20th Fox only released singles in its first year. One of them, "The Little Drummer Boy" by The Harry Simeone Chorale (original single: 20th Fox 45-121), appeared in the fall of 1958 and was an enormous smash. The album *Sing We Now of Christmas* (later re-titled *The Little Drummer Boy*; FOX 3002, TFS 4100, S 3100) appeared the following Christmas season and would become the only pre-1972 20th Century Fox album to remain on an in print status since its initial release; as the ensuing

decades unfolded, it would become one the best selling Christmas albums of all time. By January 1959, Onorati was able to report to 20th Century Fox executives that the label had cleared a gross of $350,000.[7]

Onorati had first encountered "The Little Drummer Boy" as "Carol of the Drum" at Dot and produced a recording of it that didn't surface until after the Harry Simeone version was well established with the public. Katherine K. Davis had written the piece in the mid-1940s, basing it on a pre-existing, traditional Czech Christmas carol. Sensing that with some adjustments the song might catch on, Onorati called in Davis and Simeone - a studio conductor with no experience leading a chorus - to create a revision of "Carol of the Drum," leading to the familiar standard known today. There has been expressed - at least on the web - the opinion that Onorati should not have taken credit for "The Little Drummer Boy" as he did not "write" it. However, the piece would not have existed if it hadn't been for his intervention, and today Henry Onorati is known only for his writing credit on "The Little Drummer Boy." After Simeone was let go by 20th Century Fox in 1965, he went straight to Kapp Records and recorded a competing The Little Drummer Boy album for them. The single derived from this album went head-to-head with the original in jukeboxes and on radio, gaining the upper hand in some markets.

To judge from interviews he conducted as reported in Billboard, Onorati had admirable and altruistic plans for the 20th Century Fox label. Onorati instituted the Master Art Series to identify albums that were designed to be like the movies they represented, with narrators and dialogue to bridge the usual music cues, using the very actors who appeared in the pictures. In 1959, he announced that 20th Century Fox' soundtrack album to the film The Diary of Anne Frank (FOX 3012) would be structured this way, and in 1960 announced a record of the hit stage play The Andersonville Trial (FOX 4000) that would follow a similar format, with actors George C. Scott and Albert Dekker held over from the original play. Onorati also instituted a jazz series, featuring the Glenn Miller Orchestra from the soundtracks of the 20th Century Musicals Sun Valley Serenade and Orchestra Wives (TCF 100-2), plus albums of the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra (TCF 101-2) and two LPs devoted to Piano Discoveries of Art Tatum (TCF 102-2), material sourced from the Lang-Worth Transcription Service. These appeared in addition to newly recorded albums by Eubie Blake, Stuff Smith, Claude Hopkins, Catman Crothers and Panama Francis; conductor/arranger Hugo Montenegro also made his debut as a leader on this label. From the 20th Century Fox vaults, Onorati assembled an album of Shirley Temple tracks from films (FOX 3006), an idea that had been exploited earlier with success by other labels, such as Columbia's Harmony imprint, licensing through the Music Division of 20th Century Fox. For the Temple album they brought Shirley Temple out of retirement for a fresh, current context cover shot.

When asked in April 1958 about the emerging challenges of stereo, Onorati was at pains to remind Billboard that 20th Century Fox had pioneered the use of stereophonic sound, and had in its vaults stereo recordings involving as many as seven tracks; this would include the soundtracks that Glenn Miller made for his 20th Century Fox features. Nevertheless, when the 20th Fox album Glenn Miller and his Orchestra appeared in 1959, it was released in mono, as were most other releases dating from Onorati's tenure, despite the "Stereoscope" device used on many of these albums. The stereo issue of the Miller was achieved later through an artificial stereophonic effect rechanneled from mono tapes; these tracks did not appear on disc in true stereo until 1998.[9] One has to

Both the pattern and density of clouds tend to vary; singles also used yellow streams of sunlight, which look like lightning bolts. Also, some singles compress the "0" in "20th" to simulate the appearance of the rightward tilt in the movie logo, but the albums do not.

assume there was some kind of technical or economic barrier to rendering 20th Century Fox' multi-track recordings onto 2-channel stereo audiotapes commonly used to master records. Soundtrackcollector.com has documented numerous instances where a Stereoscope album employs actual stereo on only one or two tracks on an album, whereas the balance of its contents are delivered in mono.

When The Diary of Anne Frank appeared on LP, it was a conventional soundtrack LP with no dialogue or narration. The Andersonville Trial, Masters of the Congo Jungle (aka Masters of the Belgian Congo, with audio taken from the Belgian documentary Les Seigneurs De La Foret, S 4001) and the 1960 Oh Kay! Revival album (FOX 4003) – all projects dear to Onorati – appeared in the Master Art series and sank without a trace. Onorati's proposed milestone of a movie for the mind was partly achieved with the album Abe The Rail Splitter (20th Fox 3036) by The Robert DeCormier Singers in 1961, but the concept's best representation was the soundtrack to The Longest Day (20th Century Fox FXG 5007), bridged by a narration from Lowell Thomas. This didn't appear until after Onorati was out; he had resigned from 20th Fox in February 1962 and returned to Randy Wood at Dot.[10] Production suddenly slowed to a trickle; 20th Fox released only seven albums in 1962. The

soundtrack to The Longest Day was achieved by Onorati's successor, Basil J. Bova, in close collusion with estranged studio head Darryl Zanuck, because Zanuck was interested in having the soundtrack reflect the quality of the film it represented and the story it told.

# The Basil J. Bova Era (1962-1970)

Basil J. Bova (1919-2000) stepped into the role of label head from elsewhere in the company; Bova was a cultured gentleman who shared Onorati's love of the theater. Like Onorati, Bova was himself a songwriter and furthermore had an interest in avant-garde, contemporary music. But from the first, Bova established himself as a pragmatist in his role at 20th Fox Records, and the first order of business was quelling rumors that this ever-so-adult label was planning to merge with teeny bopper hit factory Cameo Records out of Philadelphia.[11] Bova established even more ardently than had Onorati that the label was designed to reflect studio properties and contracted artists. In July 1962, Bova announced a major reorganization, and stated that in the future 20th Fox "will attempt to record film and television stars whenever possible and the record artists in turn will be promoted on film and television."[12] Bova also announced the impending release of the album Marilyn, made up of audio tracks from Marilyn Monroe's 20th Century Fox films slated for October – which turned out to be opportune, as it was released just three months after she died – The Longest Day and that for Cleopatra, which he predicted would be "the biggest blockbuster of them all."

In May 1963, Bova announced that 20th Fox was changing its name to 20th Century Fox Records<sup>13</sup>, just like the studio name, and replaced the "blue clouds and sky label" it had used since 1958 with a black label featuring the studio logo at the top, surrounded by a gold band. This design is the most familiar 20th Century Fox record label to most collectors and consumers. When Cleopatra (20th Century Fox F/SXG 5008) finally did hit stores – several months late, like The Longest Day – it was successful; going to number two on the album charts in June. However, instead of being "the biggest blockbuster of them all," Cleopatra the movie proved the biggest box office bomb to that time, losing nearly half of its $44 million cost; Marilyn Monroe's never completed, final film *Something's Got To Give* also proved costly to the studio. The ramifications of this massive hemorrhage of cash from the parent company would be felt in time, but in the short term, Bova pressed on.

Though the Marilyn album peaked just short of the Top 100, such success as it enjoyed paved the way for several similar undertakings from Bova. After President Kennedy was assassinated, John F. Kennedy: The Presidential Years 1960-1963 (20th Century Fox TFM-3127) appeared in December and competed favorably among the onslaught of Kennedy LPs that followed in the wake of the President Kennedy's assassination. Shortly before, Bova had released Freedom March on Washington (20th Century Fox TFM-3110) which also did very well; both of these albums were compiled from audio in the vaults of the Fox Movietone newsreel division. However, this was not an unqualified success; in 1964, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King filed suit against the 20th Century Fox label and won, citing that he was not an elected public official and that his "I Have a Dream" speech was used without his permission.[14] This did not stop 20th Century Fox from rearranging the album's content and re-releasing it as I Have a Dream: The Reverend Martin Luther King (20th Century Fox TFS 3201) after Dr. King himself was assassinated in 1968.

Figure 3. The familiar "ring" label, used by 20th Century Fox from 1963 to 1970. Columbus, Ohio based collector Greg Fernandez has recently shown me a crudely printed, injection molded single from late 1962 that bears a precursor to this design without the ring. (Source: author's collection.)

20th Century Fox' album slate does not necessarily reflect its industriousness in the production of singles, which were more oriented towards the pop radio market and involved many more artists than were allowed to make albums with them. One happy exception was Diane Renay, whose 1964 entry "Navy Blue" (TCF 456) brought 20th Century Fox its first hit single since "The Little Drummer Boy;" Motown alumnus Mary Wells followed in early 1965 with her hit "Use Your Head" (TCF 555). However, both label and studio was not holding to Boba's dictum that "to record film and television stars whenever possible and record artists in turn will be promoted on film and television." Despite their chart presence, the studio did nothing to move either Renay or Wells into their movie or TV interests. Perhaps for good reason; the idea was simply not successful, or at least in the way that they instituted it in projects such as Art Linkletter Narrates the Story of Where Did You Come From (20th Century Fox TFM 3107). The altruistic concept of promoting its television stars through records simply led to releases that were not going to find a home. So perhaps the obverse was also regarded as true at 20th Century Fox, despite the fact that there were plenty of Annette Funicellos out there at the time to prove such a notion was probably mistaken.

Through 1965, Bova experimented with releases from risky artists such as The New York Saxophone Quartet and psychotronic teen-idol Milan, who became "The

"Leather Boy" at MGM Records. These were put out in addition to new recordings from established names such as Dick Haymes, Kitty Kalten, Lena Horne and Benny Carter. Perhaps too late, Bova also concentrated heavily in the Folk genre in 1964-65, making the first recordings of Anne Mayo Muir and producing albums by Logan English and Turley Richards. But in 1965, the effect of the money lost through Cleopatra finally made its way felt throughout the company, and from that point until the 20th Century Fox label closed its doors in 1970 the label more or less exclusively devoted itself to releasing soundtracks from the studio. Even under that restriction, it scored big with John Williams' Valley of the Dolls soundtrack (S 4196) in 1967, featuring Dionne Warwick's vocal on the film's theme song, stylistically very close to the work of the hot songwriting team of Bacharach-David, though not actually by them. The soundtrack to Hello Dolly! (DTCS 5103, 1969), with Barbra Streisand, also did well, but mostly on the value of Streisand's star power rather than any other factor. During Bova's tenure, 20th Century Fox also issued the soundtracks to Zorba the Greek (TFS 4167, 1965), The Bible: In the Beginning (S 4184, 1966), Doctor Dolittle (DTCS 5101, 1967) and Patton (S 4208, 1970). Such buzz as might have been had on Nelson Riddle's Batman Exclusive Original Television Soundtrack Album (TFS 4180) was killed by a non-exclusive, but warmly received, competing album for RCA Victor by Neal Hefti, who had composed the show's theme. Throughout this series of soundtrack LPs, some measure of Onorati's approach remained; deluxe packages – with gatefolds and extra leaves accommodating full color photos and sometimes a summary of the story – usually accompanied the first pressing of a major soundtrack album. Often these albums used bits of dialogue to connect the various tracks together in a way that reflected the story arc, and the absence of such bumpers is an easy way to determine whether a later CD issue of a 20th Century Fox soundtrack LP was sourced from a TCF tape or the original film element.

Bova's program of documentary albums stopped in 1965, as the studio shut down its Movietone newsreel division in order to cut costs, drying up the supply of current events audio. Also in 1965, 20th Century Fox began a budget label, Movietone Records, to handle back catalogue, re-releasing all of the titles it had already re-released in an earlier "Million Seller" campaign, and adding a few later ones. Movietone was not a success and 20th Century Fox shut it down in 1967. From 1965, ABC Records took over the distributorship of the 20th Century Fox label and continued to circulate what was around of the back catalogue – including The Little Drummer Boy – even after the label folded in 1970 and during the two years that followed when it was dormant. ABC distributed 20th Century Fox records, whether single or LP, bear the device "Distributed by ABC Records, Inc." along the bottom of the label.

There is a persistent rumor in various sources that "The King of Novelty" Dickie Goodman was hired to run the 20th Century Fox label in 1963, which would have been an impressive career move for someone whose previous label, Luniverse Records, was set up for him by producer George Goldner. Elsewhere, Goodman's role at 20th Century Fox is variously described as ranging from "head of the music department" to "jingle writer." Goodman did produce one single, "Senate Hearing" (TCF 443) for 20th Century Fox in 1963 and was probably the guiding force behind an album entitled Young America Dances to TV's Greatest Hits, which featured Goodman's longtime collaborator Bill Ramal (TFS 4109). Goodman also claimed to have been the guiding force behind the LP John F. Kennedy: The Presidential Years 1960-1963. That Goodman may have

contributed in some way is not disputed; he was a very fast tape editor, and Bova would have needed one to get the album out as quickly as he did. But this kind of documentary LP was exactly the kind of project that Basil J. Bova was known for, and there is no sign that he relinquished his post at 20th Century Fox before the label closed in 1970. If so, Billboard didn't mention it, and while Bova held relatively few interviews in comparison to Onorati, had he left, they would've covered that. Had Dickie Goodman managed to move into the top spot somehow, that would've been news also.[15]

At least one source that indicates the 20th Century Fox label was also in the business of brokering other labels' singles to the UK in the early 1960s. From the scant listings that exist for 20th Century Fox (or "TCF") singles in Europe, they all seem to be identical to releases that appeared on 20th Century Fox stateside, though this does not wholly rule out the possibility that this was so.[16]

# Russ Regan's 20th Century Records (1972-1981)

The 20th Century Fox studio wasn't fully out of the woods when it restarted the label in 1972, but things were improving; Darryl Zanuck finally ended his tenuous position as studio-head-in-exile-in 1971, and fresh faces – Dennis Carothers Stanfill and Alan Ladd, Jr. – were now heading the studio. This time, the attitude behind the record division

was entirely different from before; it was placed in the hands of producer Russ Regan, who had full control of the label's content and was permitted to run it as a regular record label, to assemble his own staff of writers in collaboration with the music division, and to develop material for a pop-oriented artist pool. From the start, Regan proudly announced that his was a "brand new label from stem to stern" and this was reflected in the label's new name – "20th Century" – and it's snazzy, up-to-date design bearing no resemblance to the studio's logo.[17]

Regan brought along with him Barry White, a producer, writer and singer, and an unknown quantity in 1972. White's hit "Love's Theme" as recorded by the Love Unlimited Orchestra (TC-2069, 1973), helped to usher in the era of disco, both in terms of its sound and popularity. With 20th Century, White, the vocal group Love Unlimited and The Love Unlimited Orchestra were conspicuous forces on the Soul and Disco-driven charts in the 1970s. Within one year, Regan's 20th Century label had already surpassed and doubled the chart action seen in the entire history of its predecessor. All of which was fine by the 20th Century Fox studio, as they more or less left Regan alone, as long as The Little Drummer Boy remained in print, which it did.

Some of 20th Century's hits, such as Carl Douglas' "Kung Fu Fighting" (TC-2140) were pure camp, but they fit in well with the mood of the "Me Decade" and sounded great on disco systems and AM radio. Although his gruff, growling baritone and smooth, sexy monologues flirted with the boundaries of taste, White's work was often a cut above his more formula-oriented peers in terms of musical quality and production, and White remains an aspect of 1970s Soul music that is now considered canonical. While Soul remained 20th Century's bread and butter, the motion picture studio's contributions also made a difference; "The Morning After" (TC-2010) as sung by Maureen McGovern from the film The Poseidon Adventure (1973) was a song that you could not escape on the radio for about a year. The first two albums by Ambrosia – more in a progressive rock bag than in their later, "blue-eyed soul" sound – appeared on 20th Century, as did Mahogany Rush, Leon Haywood, John Davidson, Randy Edelman, Canadian balladeer Dan Hill, bluegrass banjo master Doug Dillard, Margo Smith, Tony Joe White, Edwin Starr, the DeFranco Family, The Ritchie Family, The Alan Parsons Project, new waver Genya Ravan, jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal and even one-offs by Bing Crosby, Wayne Newton and singing cowboy Roy Rogers.

Not all went swimmingly with the new firm; some artists in Regan's stable were dealt with rather harshly if the music didn't seem to fit the direction that 20th Century was striving for. The webpage author for 1970s California revisionist Surf band Honk<sup>18</sup> summarizes it thusly; "[Our] second album, entitled "Honk", was recorded for 20th Century Records. [...] The band finished the album but the fellows at the record company didn't like the whole second side, so it had to be scrapped. A new second side was written and recorded. Innovative, brilliant work was thrown away, never to be released. The band was pretty young and this interference with their 'art' did not sit well, but the job got done. [...] In the summer of '73 a third album was recorded, again for 20th Century Records. They thought that the band needed a little more direction so they hired recording engineer Steve Desper to record and co-produce. Desper had done stellar work on the Beach Boys albums of that time. [Honk] also recorded a lot of jazz and folk flavored material and even cut a song live with a string quartet and clarinet. This stuff blew the record company right out of the wa

ter and the band was dropped from the label." Hip-O Select, the latter-day UMG reissue label, discovered the rejected album and released it as a limited edition CD in 2004, but the discarded side from the earlier effort was never found.

During a 1993 interview the author conducted with Ambrosia's Joe Puerta for San Pedro-based newspaper *Random Lengths News*, Puerta recalled that Ambrosia' first two albums were recorded for 20th Century Fox, ending a five-years-long label search after the band was turned down by A&M. They had already established a progressive rock sound, but Puerta confirmed that 20th Century had aggressively tried to mold them into a smoother, more heavily orchestrated approach, and the two albums demonstrate an uncomfortable attempt to meld both styles. Their next album, made for Warner Bros. was progressive with a vengeance, but yielded their first hit, "How Much I Feel." After that, they hit upon their so-called "Blue-eyed Soul" approach, emphasizing the singing of guitarist David Pack, and this led to Ambrosia's greatest popularity at the turn of the '80s. But Ambrosia discovered this commercially successful direction without outside assistance. One observation made by Mike Callahan of bsnpubs.com that rings quite true is that the vast majority of the artists on the 20th Century Fox roster before 1971 had their hits for labels other than 20th Century Fox; this is also true for most of the artists who appeared on the label after 1971, it's just that more of them did manage to land success than before.

To many, it would seem Russ Regan's 20th Century was a nothing but a world of

wimpy ballads, middle-of-the road Soul and Disco. But it was doing well enough that by 1976 that Regan figured that it was time to move on, so he left to found his own Millennium label. Almost as soon as Regan was out the door, the studio changed the label name once again to 20th Century Fox Records, and redesigned the label with the traditional studio logo placed atop a movie theater in an elaborate, stylized setting similar those seen on disco labels like Casablanca. Decline did not set in right away – in 1977, the studio unveiled an unexpected mega-release in the form of the *Star Wars* soundtrack album, and this served as the label's last smash hit – and, incidentally, Dan Hill was still doing well. 20th Century Fox also assumed distribution of Carl Davis' Chi-Sound label, which had been with United Artists previously, and switched its own distribution to RCA Records; earlier, 20th Century also distributed Westbound for a time. According to Callahan, Barry White recalled that "the record company seemed to forget about him as far as promotion after Regan left," so White followed Regan out the door in 1978. The 20th Century Fox label began to coast along with the tide, producing disco records and waiting for the next big thing.

The next big thing turned out to be – the end. *Star Wars* the movie and some other popular films had brought the 20th Century Fox studio around to a degree of solvency, and that made it attractive. It was bought in 1978 by an investment group headed by Texas oilman Marvin Davis and investor Dan Rich, neither of whom particularly wanted to be in the record business. At first, the label was still fat with profits with the *Star Wars* soundtrack, so they left it alone. But ultimately Davis began to shop around for a buyer, and found one in Polygram; Davis closed the label in 1981 and closed the deal with Polygram at the beginning of 1982. The last release was a Disco compilation, *Ear Candy Vol. II* (T 638, although T 639 had been released earlier). The final years of 20th Century Fox' release schedule are littered with unused stock numbers, suggesting that the label was running out of money. Polygram, in turn, merged what had been 20th Century Fox into Casablanca; all that they were really interested in was Barry White and *The Little Drummer Boy*. Casablanca proved a good fit for the former, but an awkward one for the latter.

In 1992, Fox Music – the music publishing arm of 20th Century Fox studios, which has in recent years become a powerhouse on its own through acquisitions and properties like Titanic – dipped it's toe into the water in a limited partnership with BMG and released a few CDs. But this experiment ended swiftly, in 1995.

# Discussion

The 20th Century Fox studio learned the hard way that the manner in which they handled their recordings before they had a label of their own is the best fit for them; lease out the masters, and let others take the risk. Although the 20th Century Fox label is sometimes referred to as an "Indie," that's not really true, as it was a wholly-owned subsidiary of one of the six major Hollywood movie studios. But it was a very small part of that studio's overall operation, and certainly did not maintain the budget for promotion or publicity that the MGM label or AM-PAR enjoyed. Both of these latter concerns ultimately had only the slightest connection to their movie studio parents.

The output of Regan's 20th Century label is so aggressively commercial that it is difficult for serious minded scholars to take much of an interest in it. However, the

Figure 6. The final 20th Century Fox label, which appeared from 1977 to 1981. Singles used a lighter toned, and none-too-attractive, tan color for the part of the label that identified the selection. Distributed Chi-Sound titles are co-branded like the Westbounds, but a little more elegantly. Also, this was the only label design to include the "0" in "20th" cocked to the right, as it was in the movie logo from the introduction of Cinemascope in 1953 until the studio was bought out by News Corp. in 1985. (Source: Author's collection.)

earlier labels are a different matter: the demonstration records of the 30s and 40s are often rough, and may contain takes that were not used in the actual films. Onorati and Bova both contributed significantly to raising the profile of the documentary LP; just compare John F. Kennedy: The Presidential Years 1960-1963 to any of the other records that swamped the market in the wake of President Kennedy's assassination. Likewise, although the innovation did not catch on in the long term, they provided an extra dimension of experience in the way they handled the assemblage of soundtrack LPs. However, Onorati's promising reissue program stopped short at Temple, Miller, Dorsey, Tatum and an album of George Gershwin, sourced from piano rolls and two Movietone clips shot in the early 1930s; all but Tatum and Gershwin reappeared in the 1970s. They could have gone on and prepared albums for Alice Faye, Betty Grable and possibly other entertainers represented in the 20th Century Fox vaults, but they never did.

In discussing the failure of the pre-1972 20th Century Fox label, Mike Callahan

wonders aloud, "Was it all chalked up to bad material? Weak production? Less than adequate promotion? [...] Didn't they have any good record people at 20th Century Fox?" They did, at least at the start, but after about three years the studio stopped listening to Henry Onorati. Basil J. Bova had both taste and a gut, but refused to listen to it, preferring to fly under the radar and merely doing what the studio wanted done. It wouldn't be his fault if the plane came down, which it did. With Regan, the studio got someone it felt it could trust, and he achieved short-term profitability while lowering the bar somewhat; that some 20th Century products of the 70s have managed some staying power may almost seem like an accident to those experiencing them in the current context. But Regan's handling of talent was inflexible, and he wasn't in it for the long haul. So after he left, the ship was cast adrift, and it sank; Hip Hop happened, and they did nothing. This time, just as much fault lay with the "record people" at 20th Century Fox as with the changing of the guard at the top. Polygram must've felt it was absorbing at least some junk assets with this buy, so they simply rolled it into one of their other "junk" labels.

# Appendix A
Discography of the 20th Century Fox 78-rpm label

by David J. Diehl

The following is an exploratory listing of true rarities, movie exploitation discs which were not sold to the public. Label information is mimeographed indicating an extremely short pressing run, perhaps only for use by first run theaters in major cities and some may have been only for internal use at the studio. The earlier group is unnumbered and only access to TCF files may ever determine how many were made. Matrix numbers are from Recordings Inc., an independent Hollywood recording studio which had been used by Brunswick in the early 1930's. The early discs are pressed in shellac by Allied Manufacturing, the former Columbia pressing plant. About 1940 the TCF matrix series was adopted, possibly Twentieth Century Fox set up its own studio at that time. Highest number currently reported is TCF 241 (1943) so there are a lot of these obscurities to be documented. Worse yet, some matrices were cross-coupled in various combinations. Information sources are listed in brackets:  $\mathrm{[RDI] =}$  Rigler Deutsch Index;  $[\mathrm{GM}] =$  Moonlight Serenade: a Discography of The Glenn Miller Civilian Band by John Flowers;  $[\mathrm{BG} =$  Benny Goodman: Record of a Legend by D. Russell Connor] and special thanks to Dave Weiner [DW] for sharing details from his extensive research. Titles added by David N. Lewis signified by [UD].

[NOTE: The rather unusual formatting of this discography is necessary, as the sides are numbered, but not the records, except in one instance. It is a mixture of single-sided records and double-sided ones, and it may be useful to think of them all as single-sided records that were issued mostly as double-sided couplings, some couplings being variable. Moreover, certain records are labeled with devices other than that of 20th Century Fox; at least one is labeled with a cartoon lion device that may have come from MGM, but the content, numbering and film involved makes it clear that the origin of the record is 20th Century Fox. While it is possible that the other firms may have had a hand in getting these records made, more likely the studio ran out of pre-printed labels and the pressing concern simply borrowed label blanks at hand.]

# Listing of CD reissues from the 20th Century Fox Label (1958-1970)

by David N. Lewis

With the Universal vault fire of 1 June 2008, the very existence of a great many masters belonging to UMG and the companies absorbed by its predecessors was cast into doubt. Since then, UMG laudably has been shifting much of its archival holdings to the care of the Library of Congress, and as this material is still being processed – indeed, still being moved! – there is no hard and fast account of what was consumed in the flames at Universal City versus what managed to escape destruction, save mention of big band and pop material belonging to American Decca that did not make it. There is a general, informal rule for now, however, that “if it didn’t appear on CD, it’s probably gone,” though this does not apply to classical recordings, shipped to Germany well before the fire. However, in the case of the 20th Century Fox label, at least some of the vault had been lost before the fire – perhaps even long before. The CD reissue of Stuff Smith’s 20th Century Fox LP Sweet Swingin’ Stuff was cancelled because not even UMG could find the master tape of this mono-only album, and this was several years before the fire.[19] Many of the issues in the listing below have alternate master sources in the form of movie soundtrack elements, and others may simply be sourced from vinyl records.

What follows is a simple line listing of the CD releases of titles released on vinyl LPs by 20th Century Fox in a form at least close to, if not exactly reproducing, an album's content. Country codes are provided for non-U.S. Releases. They are listed in the release order relating to the first LP release within the 20th Fox/20th Century Fox catalog; for sake of comparison, check http://www.bsnpubs.com/fox/index.html to see what hasn't been released on CD.  $<$  connotes what 20th Century Fox record release the CD was derived from, or is parallel to; preference is shown towards stereo issues except in cases where the LP was mono only. This is followed by the original album release year. This is mainly to show how the CD is related to the Twentieth Century Fox release; certainly not all - or even very many - of these releases made use of materials prepared by the Twentieth Century Fox label for release on vinyl records.

[The 20th Century and 20th Century Fox labels of 1972-1981 have fared on the whole a lot better in terms of CD reissues than the label of 1958-1970. This is partly due to the industriousness of UMG's Hip-O Select imprint, which has revived many titles from the later part of the catalogue, and through reissues by some of UMG's overseas divisions such those in Japan and Brazil, not to mention that several former 20th Century titles were activated in the early history of compact disc through Polygram. To catalogue them all here would tend to make this article a little unwieldy in size. But as the two CDs below relate directly to the early 20th Fox label, it deserves mention.]

There is no organized discography of the 45 rpm singles released by 20th Century Fox, and one is badly needed; there were more than 700 releases in that product line. That legacy represents an entirely different profile of the company, including many artists and selections never reflected in the albums. As far as is known, there has never been a reissue in any format drawn from the 78-rpm 20th Century Fox label; such titles as were in common with these mega-obscure records that did find re-release would have been sourced from the soundtracks of the films.

# Guidelines for Discographies in the ARSC Journal

As a scholarly publication, the ARSC Journal strives to provide its readers with accuracy and detail in its articles. While there are well-accepted standards for the formatting and sourcing of scholarly articles and books, discographies have long lacked such guidelines.

The content and format of discographies may need to differ according to the purpose of the work, as well as the information available to the compiler, and variations of the new guidelines may be discussed with the Editor. Discographers, however, are asked to make every effort to incorporate as many as possible of the elements that are detailed in the guidelines, which can be downloaded at:

http://www.arsc-audio.org/DiscographicalGuidelines.pdf

The guidelines also appear in Vol. 37, No. 1 (2006) of the ARSC Journal (pp.14-20).
