# Crowds, Clouds, and Idols: New Dynamics and Old Agendas in the Music Industry, 1982-2012

The claim that the popular music industry as a whole was dying was made in a wide range of forums between the emergence of mass illegal downloads in the late 1990s and the dropoff in album sales that began around 2001-2, a drop that resulted in a halving of the sales of recorded music by 2012. The declarations of ruin, which continued through at least 2011, came from major news outlets, industry insiders, academics, high-profile musicians, and so-called digital visionaries. While this claim was often stated as if it were part of a larger presumed consensus, it was very often used for plainly varied purposes. On the one hand, this claim was used as a carefully chosen rhetorical device that proved politically convenient for the entertainment industry in its long, mostly successful campaign to transform intellectual property law in the United States and around the world. On the other, it allowed some to herald the end of the "old" music industry as the clunky old containers that held music in place gave way to an industry potentially revived through flexible, mobile, geographically unrestrained consumption.

Regardless of the rhetorical contests surrounding it, this claim is important to get to grips with, as it obscures salient aspects of the ways in which the music industry has changed since the turn of the century. Importantly, it is not hard to find evidence that shows us that more recorded music is being experienced across more platforms, devices, and media in more places more often than ever before. Indeed, there are at least two very simple measures that should suggest that the music industry was not in

such a derelict state as was often suggested in this period: headphone sales and performing rights revenues both hit all-time highs in 2010-11. In 2011 one major royalty collector said simply, "More music is being consumed today than ever before."4 Even the music industry's own numbers have told a different story, as have some of the music industry's highest profile successes of the first ten or so years of the new century. There is simply a wide range of facts that cannot be easily incorporated into the death-rattle narrative some quarters of the industry have pursued for so long.

These apparent contradictions strongly point to the need for a more detailed reconsideration of the period in which the future of the music industry seemed most mired in a lethal crisis, from about 1999 to 2010 or so, by placing these years in the larger historical trajectory of the period from 1982 to 2012. There are three broad tasks pursued here in service of this reconsideration.

First, we need a more lucid understanding of how the music industry has worked to adapt to the digital economy in music. While this period of time is replete with reluctant, halting efforts that were laced with some impressive failures, several of which are detailed below, the causes of those failures need to be more widely understood.[5] Some influential figures within the music industry were adapting to a digital economy in music both conceptually and practically far earlier than many might have suspected and with a degree of prescience rarely ascribed to their industry as a whole. This was especially true in relation to digital streaming services.

Second, we need a clearer understanding of what people meant when they said that the music industry was "dying." Clearly, few, if any, commentators thought the music industry would no longer be able to make money from the experience of music. The more salient questions were about how to make money from music in a context of increasing media saturation and technological change. Specifically, it needs to be acknowledged that a very carefully restricted definition of "the music industry" was crafted by a few of this industry's dominant entities to reflect a similarly circumscribed focus on album sales as the sole public measure of the industry's overall health. In short, for the big players in the music industry, as album sales fell, the health of "the music industry" did too. While this formulation was clearly a rhetorical gambit designed to most effectively put the antipiracy case to the public, it also happened to exclude from serious consideration one of the music industry's most undeniable successes in this period: music-based reality television. Importantly, when considered within the broader corporate strategic landscape within which the entertainment industry as a whole was operating at that time, there was some form of truth to the claim. There remain persistent barriers to entry into the music industry despite

the significant change in its technological base. It is precisely these barriers that are largely responsible for the continued dominance of a small number of corporations over most sales of recorded music and the small number of artists whose recordings make up the vast majority of those sales, regardless of how reduced overall sales figures may have been. Further, despite much confident prognostication, the fabled "long-tail" market of the "new" music industry simply had not emerged by 2012.<sup>6</sup> Therefore, the politics and rhetoric surrounding the sales of recorded music are central to this time period.

Third, we need to more fully understand the incontrovertible successes produced in this period, most notably, music-based reality television, and the relationship these successes have to the larger changes in the music industry, especially the advent of music streaming services. We need a much broader understanding of why a long-standing phenomenon such as music-based reality television could have thrived at the exact same time as the most dire claims of disaster but only rarely be recognized as a conceptual, strategic, or structural model for the future of this industry. In the final section of this article, we will see how music-based reality television and contemporary streaming services both grew from the same conceptual and strategic soil. Specifically, both phenomena were made possible by the shift to a music industry primarily concerned with managing and profiting from its immense stores of intellectual property in a global economy marked by cheap, easy-to-source labor, pervasive mobile and digital consumption, outsourced production of content, and the exponentially increased size of its potential markets.

My primary goal is to extract from these points a more precise recognition of the continuities exhibited by central, important, and influential parts of the music industry through the period of its greatest disruption in recent history. This examination of these continuities is intended to act as a corrective supplement to the larger, dominant narratives that focus mostly on disruption and chaos. While the disruptions and upheavals in the music industry have been explored in impressive and profitable detail, the continuities in the music industry over this important period have received far less attention.<sup>7</sup> The continuities examined throughout this article demonstrate that despite the complex forms of change the music industry has been facing over the period in question, certain key facts remain stubbornly persistent. First, the same small number of large corporations has maintained a substantial range of power and influence over the global music industry. Second, despite the obvious turmoil they have faced, these entities have managed to continue pursuing the same narrow range of interests and objectives in order to maintain that power. Third, over the same period, roughly the same small percentage of artists still managed to take the lion's share of music sales despite the radical opening up of technological and economic access to new, cheaper, and

better means of distribution. $^{8}$  We need to work toward some understanding of why these facts might persist.

Presented below is a wide-ranging compilation of evidence to account for the above-noted points of continuity within the turmoil of this period. The most important of these has been the music industry's continuing ability to assemble the kinds of social and economic relationships that allow it to create a mass audience, a context in which that audience can find satisfying ways to consume music, and convince enough people that what they were experiencing was worthwhile enough to do so repeatedly. The music industry's main way of doing this remains the exploitation of the perceived benefits of the experience of music, or what some scholars have called its "affordances," to create various kinds of social, cultural, and economic relationships with as many consumers as possible and to maintain these relationships as long as possible.[9] The main actors in the music industry—especially big labels such as Sony/BMG, Universal, and the Warner Music Group—have long used the dynamic relationship between the emotional and social investment most of us make in music to extract financial gain from our experience of it. What is of most interest here is how the dynamic relationships between these various social and economic relationships have evolved in recent decades. From the early to mid-1980s onward, a steadily decreasing number of large corporations increasingly dominated the music industry. They deliberately worked to constrain the options available for the exploitation of the experience of music down to one: the full-length album on compact disc. Yet there were several important countervailing forces that emerged in this period as well. The ways and means through which music was being experienced were proliferating, becoming more numerous in both technological form and geographic spread. Whether through film, television, radio, mobile phones, or the Internet, the size and scope of potential markets for recorded music grew to unprecedented size. This trajectory has culminated in the more or less ubiquitous availability of recorded music in the world's largest and most lucrative markets for it, creating both unavoidable crises and myriad opportunities. On the one hand, the music industry can now reach more people more immediately than ever. On the other, the shape and character of many of those connections largely transcend the kinds of tangible transactions the music industry depended on until the mid-1990s, provoking the lengthy crisis that has only recently begun to abate.[10]

The dynamic relationship between these two sets of forces evolved over the period from 1982 to 2012. It is clear that, from the mid-1980s forward, the economic basis of the primary relationship between the music industry and consumers on which its success depended for decades was one in which consumers bought and possessed what the music industry produced through reasonably tangible transactions, such as buying 45s,

LPs, or CDs. Further, the few dominant players in the music industry focused most intently on increasing album sales through the 1980s and 1990s. However, the social and economic relationships that formed the basis of the music industry's continued existence have always acted in tandem with social and economic relationships in which the music industry either produced or exploited various experiential contexts for music in which the consumer participates as part of a longer-term, more habitual social relationship, such as that offered through radio or television. Through the comparative analysis of digital music streaming services and music-based reality television shows that concludes this article, it is clear that one of the most important aspects of this period of crisis for the music industry has been the rapid evolution of the dynamic relationship between these complex, varied, co-mingled, social, and economic relationships. Music streaming and music-based reality television bear remarkable and telling similarities distinctly well suited to the emergence of a "new" music industry.

The exploitation of the dynamic relationship between selling tangible products by using various venues for experiencing music has deep historical roots. Music has always been right on the cusp of developments in new media, whether we are talking about the printing press, sound recording, radio, film, television, or digital media. Yet within the well-known series of conflicts and crises over new technologies in the music industry since before the introduction of sound recording, one key thread in these contests has persisted. The experience of music and the exploitation of this experience through the production and possession of discrete artifacts is plainly inseparable from the kinds of relationships created by the far less tangible complex of social rituals and experiential circumstances always occasioned by music. It is the affordances of these circumstances, such as the endlessly varied forms of social connection, imaginative response, and emotional sustenance, that the experience of music provides, that the music industry needs to link to more immediately tangible transactions in order to survive.[11]

We can see the dynamic relationship between these two kinds of social and economic relationships being used to contest the character of the music industry at several key turns in the past hundred years or so. There have been repeated and dramatic shifts in the relationship between the production of musical products to be possessed by consumers and the exploitation of the experience of music both as an end in itself and as an enticement to buy other things. Throughout the last century, music has been immediately and intimately allied with the advent of every major new form of audiovisual media as part of a larger experiential enticement into new forms of social, cultural, and economic connection.[12] In this respect, it should be obvious that the music industry has been enthusiastically and aggressively insinuating itself into more and

more areas of social life for well over a century and has often done so with extraordinary success. The complex dynamic interaction between the kinds of relationships enacted by the production and possession of music in some material form and those produced by experience and habit has been the underlying force in the development of nearly every form of contemporary media through which we consume music.

One of the main reasons the music industry hasn't died through any of the preceding crises and transitions brought about by new forms of media is that enough parts of it have remained reasonably capable of doing what they have always done to survive: muster up a mass audience by giving them convenient, satisfying ways to consume music and making a good number of those people feel that what they were consuming was worthwhile enough to do so over and over again. Despite the often radical changes to these tasks in the last decade or so, they have still managed to persist. Most recently, it has been digital music streaming and music-based reality television that have provided the environments in which the sorts of crowds the music industry thinks it needs to survive can be assembled. For better or worse, these are two of the mediums that are most obviously pointing us forward into what remains a murky future.

In 1999 Reebee Garofalo presented a comprehensive analysis of the underlying forces that shaped the political economy of the music industry across the length and breadth of the twentieth century. One of his main conclusions was that in order to understand the evolution of the music industry across this time period one had to definitively link the complex interactions of the broader developments in cultural production and expression to the intentions and actions of those with the technological, political, and economic power to most effectively direct or exploit those developments.[13] One of the main goals here is to build on Garofalo's framework by relying on more recent work in order to the bring the analysis of the same forces underlying the evolution of the music industry between about 1982 and 2012 to the fore. This article is meant to point us toward an enhanced understanding of the continuities exhibited in the music industry across the last two decades, not just a reiteration of the obvious turbulence and disruption. Before this, however, it is important to recount how easy assumptions of music industry recalcitrance in the face of overwhelming technological change are not the simple, clear stories they are often purported to be.

# The Consensus That Wasn't

In 1999, 2001, and 2002 four mostly unrelated analytical pieces appeared that set about describing the unenviable economics of selling music in our soon-to-be-digital world. These articles were quite distinct from

one another in form, source, and methodology. However, when taken together they collectively present a reasonably insightful set of parameters for the survival of this "dying" industry. We can see that they established the outlines of the conceptual framework for a good deal of what has happened in the music industry since about 2002 without necessarily claiming to do so. Specifically, we can extract from these articles a clear understanding of the fact that some within the music industry recognized three crucial dynamics of the shift to digital: (1) the profoundly disruptive force of free exchange online, (2) the basic resources the music industry could not abandon despite the acknowledged presence of this force, and (3) the strategies the music industry thought it would have to pursue in order to perpetuate its dominance over the production, distribution, and sale of music into a suddenly unreliable future. This analysis is meant to show that these articles are emblematic of the fact that most of the major ideas about the various potential futures facing the music industry that gradually came to the fore by about 2010-11 or so had long been present within or around the music industry. Further, taken as a group, they clearly show that it was the dynamic relationship between new experiential contexts for music and the music industry's ability to economically exploit these contexts that was most at stake in this period.

The first two of these articles appeared a few months before Napster went online. They were both published in Wired on April 4, 1999, and featured industry consultant Jim Griffin, often said to be one of the more perceptive observers of the music industry's transition to digital.[14] Griffin clearly recognized the multifarious power of an open Internet. Rather than counsel resistance, Griffin advised accommodation. He argued that mp3 downloading, while not containable, was mostly a way station on the road to a music industry defined by flat-fee, subscription-based audio streaming services. Against the prevailing hysteria, he argued that the "economic model behind streaming and ubiquitous access obviates piracy. Intellectual property gains value as it is widely distributed, much like television or radio."[15] Like many observers, Griffin recognized that the trajectory of the Internet was toward increasing speed, bandwidth, and mobility of access, which meant that, given that the value of digital content is "plummeting towards zero . . . unless we stop letting people listen to music, we have no way to control the quantity and the destination of those digits."[16] Griffin, like a few others in and around the music industry, saw that industry's future as a content aggregator funneling music to consumers "whether from portable devices, home stereos, or desktop PCs. By aggregating content, the major labels could offer music services that let consumers customize channels in whatever fashion they like, and pay a monthly, all-you-can-eat fee similar to the broadcast models used by AOL and HBO." According to Griffin, "the distribution chain [was] being wasted on delivering digits on a plastic disc.... Once freed

up, we can sell items associated with music that have higher margins. It's actually a better business to not sell the content. Selling items associated with the music is where it's at.[17] As we will see toward the end of this article, these points coincide almost precisely with those forms of music-based reality television that would emerge starting in 1999.

It is easy to read these kinds of comments now and take them for granted. But in 1999, two years before the iPod and eight years before the iPhone made their now-storied appearances on the consumer market, it probably would not have been unreasonable to see Griffin's blunt claims as mere speculation, given the range of things that would have to happen for the world he imagined to come into being. There are two areas of interest here: the practices the major labels would have to defend to maintain their dominance over the global music market and those they would have to reinvent or refashion to do so. An exemplary study published in 2001 by Martin Kretschmer and colleagues explained in detail what they were trying to defend.[18] Drawing from qualitative interviews with a substantial range of music industry executives, musicians, band managers, publishers, and those working in copyright agencies, international trade organizations, and other relevant industries, the researchers extracted a set of defensive strategies the music industry had already been using in dealing with the shift to digital. First, the major record labels refused to license their catalogs to third parties offering digital distribution. The goal was to avoid creating a new market that "cannibalized" the existing one.[19] As suggested later, cannibalization is not the straightforward issue it might seem to be. Second, they were working to assert legal and technological control over their content.[20] This was accomplished through a largely successful campaign to transform intellectual property law, a campaign that preceded the turn-of-the-century piracy crises by many years.[21] Third, they were working to establish new kinds of relationships with various parts of the media, computer, and Internet industries while still trying to maintain something approaching a dominant position within these relationships. Finally, they tried to develop their own "procedural competencies in the new technology" and thereby establish their own brands "as the music navigator of the online environment."[22] While the results of these efforts before 2012 were decidedly mixed, the researchers accurately concluded that "we should expect that initially the established players would act defensively while new patterns of dis- and reintermediation emerge."[23]

These new patterns of intermediation were foreseen the next year by someone who didn't actually think they would eventuate. In an article that appeared in Wired in 2002 under the somewhat alarmist headline "The Year the Music Died," Charles Mann of the Atlantic told readers very plainly what practices he thought the major labels needed to change to sustain their market power. In the midst of a good deal of sharply

worded analysis, Mann laid out his inadvertent master plan: "To leap the hurdles posed by digital technology, the industry must find a way to make money selling downloaded music on a per-track basis . . . slash recording costs with cheap software and hardware, and change artists' contracts to reflect the new economic reality. Doing any one of these will be next to impossible. Doing all of them would be one of the more amazing turnarounds in business history."[24] To do this, Mann argued, the industry had to "make file-swapping more difficult, and legitimate online services easier and less expensive."[25] Mann recognized the obvious need on the part of the music industry to establish strong relationships with the computer and Internet industries, or what he called at the time, "friends it didn't have."[26] As I will show throughout the remainder of this article, if we take all four of these articles together, they describe much of what has happened in the music industry between about 2002 and 2012. As I show, while the music industry conceded significant ground on some issues, such as licensing its catalogs to third parties, it has still been able to exert the very powerful leverage of intellectual property ownership within its new alliances to extract some very significant advantages.

There are two key caveats for what follows. First, the simple appearance of these ideas and arguments should not attribute any degree of inevitability to them, nor should we necessarily accord their authors with any unusual degree of foresight. These ideas were not nearly as isolated and contrarian as they might appear to us today. Second, there are no predictions as to the longevity of the efforts and agendas these ideas in the near or long-term future set out below. Instead, we need to understand why these ideas were borne out to the extent that they were in the period examined here because they point to a necessary reassessment of the dynamics between the different types of social and economic relationships between the music industry and consumers under consideration here.

# Persistent Barriers to Entry

There were two issues that dominated the discussion in the literature examining the often painful transition to digital in the music industry. One important theme surrounded the future of the music industry between about 1999 and 2012 or so. There was a broad consensus that the Internet would inevitably create a music industry defined by new kinds of "direct" relationships between musicians and fans. This was widely thought to create the conditions for a more diverse and varied industry less reliant on a small number of superstar artists producing massive hits to fund the rest of the industry.[27] The second, which followed directly from this, was the issue of album and single sales and the ways in which these may or may not have changed since their decline began

in 2001. In both cases, we can see that the terms "music industry" and "dying" often had very particular and very narrow meanings in these debates. Specifically, the term "music industry" was most often used synonymously with the small number of dominant players in the global music market. The term "dying" was used mostly to describe the drop-off in album sales by these same dominant players that began around 2001. As we will see here, there are some very specific reasons for this.[28]

The idea that the Internet would, by its very architecture, transform most social and economic relationships was by no means limited to the music industry. It was part of a much larger and very influential set of ideas put forward by a small collection of people who, regarding themselves as countercultural figures, argued for the great "leveling" power of the Internet. This leveling would mean that the state would mostly vanish, and the corporation would implode. Civil society would blossom, and centralized authorities of all kinds would atrophy.[29] All of this would happen specifically because the liberated and autonomous individual would be able to negotiate with large institutions from a position of equality; the Internet would gradually wear the power of these institutions down. We were repeatedly told that all musicians would really need was a small group of devoted adherents whose support they could leverage into the various forms of emotional, monetary, and material investment musicians needed to make a good living without relying on intermediaries to exert that leverage for them.[30]

However, while it has clearly become much easier to record and offer music to a potential mass audience, this has simply not led to "direct" and persistently profitable relationships between most musicians and their fans. Several traditional and persistent barriers to entry into the music industry still appear to exert a powerful influence. The term "barrier to entry" is used to denote precisely the lack of sustained profitability experienced by many despite increased access to larger numbers of consumers at lower costs. As Kretschmer and colleagues noted, these barriers have been numerous. One is the "complex, capital-intensive logistics of an international distribution network that must cope with sudden changes in demand."31 Second are the huge marketing costs involved not just with bringing music to market but with making it stick when it gets there. Indeed, the logistics of this can be so daunting that the "winner-take-all" market in music in which "nobody knows the reasons for success" remains heavily laden with serious risk and almost shocking levels of failure.32 Finally, the music industry's aggressive if not ruthless management of intellectual property "allows the hedging of risks in a way unavailable to new entrants focusing on the promotion of new material."33 These factors have led many independent record labels onto the rocks in the past.34 While the availability of various online services or devices was said to significantly mitigate or even eliminate these risks, this has not happened, at least not yet.35

There are several key forms of continuity within the music industry that show us that these barriers to entry are still exerting a consequential force in the market for music. Despite all of the obvious tumult in recent years, there are a few sales and revenue numbers that show that some very important things haven't really changed very much. The first form of continuity is the fact that the sales numbers described below are a direct consequence of the fact that the entertainment industry, of which the music industry is a comparatively small part, has continued its multi-decade trend toward industrial consolidation and global market expansion. This has resulted in a smaller number of larger corporations that own and control an increasing majority of the companies the make, sell, and profit from recorded music. In 1996 six big corporations controlled about 80 percent of the global music market.[36] By 2012 there were three even bigger corporations that controlled a slightly larger percentage of the total global sales of recorded music.[37]

Another result of this long-term trend toward consolidation has been how familiar certain types of changes in the long-term numbers for the sales and value of recorded music have been since the early 1980s. Despite the dire claims of the big labels, they really weren't doing that badly, all things considered, even as late as about 2003-4. Of course, it was around this point that overall album sales began their precipitous decline to about half their former value. It is helpful to understand these changes in their larger historical trajectory. After the global recession of the late 1970s, the music industry began to recover by about mid-1982. The introduction and industrially enforced dominance of the CD, starting in 1983, as well as a selective but significant global economic expansion in the 1980s and 1990s, produced a nearly unbroken upward curve of sales value of recorded music that lasted from about late 1982 until 2001. After 1986 the numbers were better than anyone had ever seen. Simply put, if you counted what was being sold and how much money was being made from selling it, the value of recorded music increased steadily for a very long time.[38] As Billboard noted in 2004, the "industry began a run of unprecedented growth in 1986, according to the Recording Industry Assn. of America. That streak came to a halt in 2001 when album sales were off  $2.9\%$ ." [39] A lot was made of the fact that this was the first decline in album sales since the CD was introduced.[40] The lobbyists representing the music industry claimed that piracy was to blame, somewhat hysterically estimating that low-cost CD-R burners had allowed 640 million pirated discs to be sold worldwide. When one added the IFPI's estimates of illicit cassettes into the mix, the number of pirate "sales" jumped to 1.8 billion, a number that was far bigger than all worldwide sales of legal copies of all recorded music.[41] Yet despite all this alleged lawlessness, there are many credible arguments that the size of what some analysts call the "broader music industry" has still been expanding since 2001, even as album sales have declined dramatically.[42]

As noted in the introduction, there were many contending forces running into each other in this period. New technology was only one. On the one hand, the global market in music was growing significantly throughout this period and becoming much more immediately accessible to its biggest players. In sum, the small number of larger corporations that dominated the music industry could make more money by selling more music to more people in more ways in 1999 than they could in 1989. On the other hand, this also meant that more music was being used in more profitable ways in more places than had ever been the case before. This fact served to link the music industry more and more directly with other parts of the global entertainment industry, many parts of which had priorities that contradicted an increasingly singular focus on selling full-length albums. Therefore, while this long upward trend in the expansion of the global market for music might seem to contradict the often apocalyptic rhetoric that has surrounded the music industry, the important thing to remember about any public accounting of the health of "the music industry" is that it was far too often exclusively about "sales of recorded music," that is, the sales numbers produced by the three or four most powerful of the major record labels that routinely refer to themselves, inaccurately, as "the music industry."[43]

Specifically, despite the rapid proliferation of the forms, sources, and channels that let us consume music, a lot of things got lost or marginalized in the process of counting and reporting on the resulting sales numbers.[44] Until very recently, the numbers used to measure the health of "the music industry" provided by those who claimed to do the counting most reliably specifically excluded revenues from live performance, merchandising, digital streaming, publishing royalties, public performance royalties, and any sales revenue related to things like ringtones or the use of songs in video games, television shows, or films.[45] The numbers said to tally sales of albums and singles also exclude a lot of independent producers, distributors, retailers, and often whole countries or even entire geographic regions thought to be too small to matter in the big picture. Most measures purporting to assess the state of the music industry do so mostly by defining the term "sales of recorded music" as the sales of albums produced by record labels owned by the main conglomerates sold in major retail chains along with a few cautious estimates about the kind of trade some independent record labels and retailers might be doing. Simply put, the term "music industry" has often been a very selective, even speculative term that has had very particular meanings, in this case denoting a very small range of activities conducted by only the most powerful entities.

Perhaps just as importantly, the often highly rhetorical parsing of music industry sales numbers has most often been used to express a fundamental distinction in the market for music that the most powerful

entities in that market had no choice but to emphasize: the importance of market value over sales numbers. It is this necessary preference that has defined the market in music since the recovery of the early 1980s, after which most of the record labels responsible for most sales began to be incorporated into the larger entertainment industry and the values and directives of the form of global capitalism commonly referred to as "neoliberal globalization" that came to dominate the world economy between the mid-1980s and the present.[46] It is this distinction that has caused one of the most consequential problems the music industry faced in recent decades: the exclusive embrace of the album to the detriment, exclusion, or even wholesale destruction of competing formats. As should become clear in the next section, the increasingly exclusive focus on album sales was part of the quest for ever-rising market value, not just increased sales numbers. The treatment of the single format by the music industry from about the early 1990s until the early 2000s is a case in point in the effort to enhance market value over sales numbers, an effort that is ongoing. It was during this period that the term "dying" became almost entirely synonymous with collapsing album sales.

# Cue: Dramatic Interlude

As noted above, the gradual intermingling and collision between a radically expanding global market for music and the many competing uses for music within that larger market provided both opportunities and problems for the dominant players in the music industry. On the one hand, these large corporations were the most suited to quickly adapt to and exploit broader changes in the global economy. On the other, that new global economy was far more crowded and competitive than those that preceded it. These forces came to a head with the advent of mass illegal downloading and file sharing starting in 1999, a historical moment when technological change briefly outpaced everyone. Yet despite the underlying changes in the market for music, which largely preceded the technological upheavals of recent years, certain key facts have persisted. The same small number of corporations continued to dominate the global market in recorded music, and very small percentages of artists still sold vastly more than their less financially successful peers.

We will now focus on the two sides of this equation. In the next section, we will see how the dominant players in the music industry continued to focus more and more on facilitating the kinds of social and economic relationships suited to selling ever-increasing numbers of recordings. Their increased focus on selling full-length albums deliberately crowded out other options. Specifically, it is important to see that this was a strategically necessary and not altogether irrational strategy if considered only within the largely myopic assumptions under which the big players

in the music industry were operating at the time. However, at the same time, they were increasingly faced with a broad range of new environments and delivery systems to experience that music. Simply put, there were huge new vistas of musical experience becoming available through new forms of media that eventually transcended and became mostly detached from the sale of tangible physical artifacts. In the final section of this article, it should become clear that music-based reality television and digital streaming services were aptly suited to these new environments of experiencing music through television, film, mobile phones, and the Internet. Some looked at these new soundscapes and saw nothing but piracy and vice. Others looked at them as rich new experiential environments to exploit. It is the balance and intermingling between these two understandings of the potential economic exploitation of musical experience that is central to a clear understanding of the recent history of the music industry.

# Selling the Album, Deleting the Single

In the 1990s the dominant players in the music industry worked diligently and assiduously to wipe out a staple of low-cost music consumption, the single.[47] There are three key issues to take into account to understand this quixotic attempt at planned obsolescence. First, the most important consequence of the effort to eliminate the single was, at the time, a widely recognized shift to illegal downloads by those said to be uninterested in buying whole albums. Second, the remarkable persistence in the character of certain specific sales curves and patterns throughout the 1990s and early 2000s suggests that the issue of "cannibalization" may not be as simple as is often claimed. If we look closely at the ways in which music actually sold in this period, we will see very clearly that the extraordinary profits garnered from the dominance of sales of full albums on CD in the mid- to late nineties were profoundly anomalous. Third, it is very important to note that this was a largely necessary anomaly. The one factor almost all sources analyzing the many failures of the music industry in this period have not acknowledged is that these corporations are legally bound to do everything in their power to expand their market value above all other considerations.[48] This is a bedrock principle of the systems of corporate law and governance that define neoliberal globalization, that set of economic values and goals that have dominated the global economy for the past several decades. These principles defined the response of the music industry to new entrants in the market for music, and they inspired the seemingly quixotic campaigns to stamp out all formats for music consumption other than the full album on compact disc.

Singles have been consistently and remarkably popular for decades all over the world because they are cheap, durable, and attractive.[49] Despite

this, the three or four major players in the music industry listed above have repeatedly tried to stamp them out.[50] They have done so for two reasons. First, obviously, albums are worth a lot more than singles. More importantly, a string of multiplatinum albums will contribute far more to the perception of the market value of a company than any number of hit singles. The effort at building market value, or the perceived overall value of a company and its assets, is an ongoing effort sometimes undertaken even in preference to enhancing the sales numbers of what that company produces. Second, the big labels were afraid of what they called "cannibalization." As Billboard explained, "Many label executives believe singles sales cannibalize album sales, and their companies don't issue singles or, if they do, cut them out once a song becomes a hit, with the hope that fans will buy the album."[51]

We can trace the enforced decline of the single back to the early nineties, when most major record labels began deleting singles from their catalogs as soon as a song became a hit, a practice designed to force album sales upward. The next logical step was to stop producing any singles at all for most album releases.[52] The very small numbers of singles that were released were produced to try to boost early chart positions, with labels often deliberately selling them so cheaply that they were unprofitable.[53] These convoluted tactics appear to have worked, but only briefly. In 1995 the IFPI claimed that "worldwide sales at retail values were worth $39.7 billion," a jump of nearly 10 percent from the previous year. This growth was fueled by the strong growth in the sales of albums on CD.[54] Despite the fact that the growth of sales for singles remained a perplexingly strong "phenomenon in the big music markets with sales in Japan, the U.S., the U.K., Germany and France accounting for 90% of the global market," the practice of deleting singles only become more scrupulous.[55] We can see this clearly in the sales numbers that came from Nielsen-Soundscan research undertaken at the end of 1999. In that year, in the dominant US market, new hit albums on CD were the driving force of the continuing expansion of the market in recorded music. This jump in market value came directly at the expense of competing formats. Cassettes were deliberately consigned to obsolescence despite strong, consistent, global demand for them both as singles and as albums.[56] Singles in all formats experienced a "precipitous drop" in numbers, which, unsurprisingly, "industry observers" attributed to "a reluctance on the part of the major record companies to release singles."[57]

Not everyone agreed with the practice. According to *Billboard*, some "retailers argue that a low-priced music configuration is essential if the industry wants to encourage young consumers to buy music," and "since labels mostly refuse to release hit songs on the format, that group is turning to the internet to download pirated copies of those tunes or asking friends to burn the more costly albums that contain them."58 One reporter for *Billboard* summed up the late 1990s music market very succinctly,

if simplistically, when he said that "pushing bundled products down the throats of consumers in the form of bloated, overpriced CDs, plus the deletion of physical singles, is what drove the revolution in song downloading."59

By start of 2002 the single was meant to be a nostalgic remnant of a bygone era. The single was pronounced dead after falls of 23.8 percent in 1999, 36 percent in 2000, and 41 percent in 2001, ultimately landing on the lowest number of singles sold since the early 1950s.[60] Despite half-hearted efforts by some to revive the format, such as five- and six-track "singles" sold at higher prices or rereleases of "classic tracks" intended to avoid cannibalization, the matter appeared to be closed. The final push to bury the single once and for all began in 1999. The timing was telling, as the music industry unwittingly picked what was probably the absolute worst moment in history to try and finish the job; it was the year Napster appeared, and illegal downloads of single tracks began to surge in an unprecedented way.

The intense focus on selling albums through the promotion of one or two hit songs resulted in a hugely important continuity between the "old" music industry and the "new" one, an impressively persistent type of sales curve that remained an embedded characteristic of the mainstream music industry to at least 2012. This sales curve is defined by a vertical axis that exhibits a death-defying drop from the upper left corner of the graph, in which a small number of albums sell a very large number of copies, all the way down close to the bottom of the graph, where a very long "tail" begins to stretch off into the nether regions of the horizontal axis all the way to the lower right-hand corner of the graph. At that end, a very large number of albums sell very few copies. Since at least the mid-1990s and possibly earlier, Nielsen-Soundscan has reported that sales figures for the largest record companies have shown that a very small number of albums accounted for a huge chunk of total sales. In 1995 0.2 percent of all the albums that were available for sale that year tallied up about 40 percent of all sales. The next 2 percent of albums accounted for 32.6 percent of sales, and all the remaining sales were spread across the remaining album releases; these releases numbered over 140,000.[61] Over 90 percent of the albums available that year sold fewer than 5,000 copies. We can find similar numbers in subsequent years as well.[62] In 1997 through 1999, the percentage of sales clocked up by a decreasing number of hit albums had ticked up even further by 1999.[63] In 2000, even though the industry produced twice as many albums as in the previous year, still only 0.35 percent of all of the 288,592 titles being tracked accounted for 56 percent of the total market.[64] We can find the same story more recently, as just over 400 titles out of a total of the 33,443 new albums released in 2002 accounted for about 72 percent of total sales.[65] In 2005 about 0.7 percent of an even larger total number of

new releases accounted for about the same percentage of sales.[66] Finally, in 2011, out of the more than 75,000 new releases noted across the whole music industry, only 1,500 titles, or 2 percent of the total, accounted for over 90 percent of total sales.[67]

Remarkably, this sales curve persisted even after the market in digital downloads was established. As *Billboard* calmly pointed out in 2011, "Continuing a years-long trend, the top digital sellers in the United States are grabbing an increased share of sales, thanks to a surprisingly vibrant digital market."[68] Interestingly, it appears that this sales curve is not limited to music people buy. Those who studied download patterns on peer-to-peer networks thought they may have found a very similar curve. As the researchers note, when comparing legal sales and file trading, "both legal and illegal music consumption patterns are tucked up against the bottom left axis, contrary to Long Tail-like expectations, suggesting that much of the volume is concentrated amongst a small proportion of the available tracks."[69]

Despite the massive changes in the market for music, this resolute feature of that market persisted even when many other important variables changed dramatically. For example, the average number of new releases more than doubled between 2004 and 2011. While some of the increase has been attributable to a greater number of independent releases, the major record labels have increased their output more than commensurately.[70] Also, one of the biggest changes over the last ten years is the sheer number of songs now available digitally. According to many influential digital luminaries, this expansion of the available range of music is precisely why we were supposed to be seeing a very different kind of music market, one defined by its "long tail." On the sales graph that I described above, the massive downward curve should have become less steep as top sellers accounted for a smaller percentage of total sales, and the tail should have gotten "thicker" as the sales numbers for all those many, many titles on the lower reaches of the graph rose. While there has been some evidence that shows that the percentage of albums bought digitally has ceded some ground to the "tail" albums, small numbers of hit albums still dominate in roughly the same proportions they did in 1999, and hit singles are even more dominant than ever; very little has changed in terms of general ratios of sales of so-called physical goods (i.e., actual CDs).[71] As Billboard tersely concluded, "Labels have continued to focus on finding hits for a reason: It's almost impossible for them to make any real money any other way."[72] For artists, the digital panacea has been slow to materialize, because "although niche titles collectively account for a greater percentage of sales, no individual one accrued any meaningful income—and few have received the attention their creators would need to perform or sell merchandise at a time when those revenue streams are becoming more important."[73] We can again

see that the dominant market position of the big three translates into some advantage in terms of getting people's attention and turning that attention into money. While there still may be a "long tail" revolution lurking out there somewhere, the fact remains that it simply hadn't happened by 2012.[74]

One of the main reasons for these particular forms of continuity in the market for music is that the market in music was and continues to be operated as a cartel. This is not a metaphor. It is the actual description given to the music industry multiple times by entities such as the European Union, the US Federal Trade Commission, and the attorneys general of forty-two American states, among others.[75] Like all cartels, the goal is to control prices by colluding to restrict competition. The sales curve I have been describing is, in part, the result of this. There are other consequences of this in the music industry. They are numerous and point to some of the equally significant problems that have dogged the music industry for years, beyond file sharing.

In 2007 *Billboard* published the results of one of its regular analytical forays into the numbers tallied up by Nielsen-Soundscan. Its goal was to track the potential for the development and nurturing of new artists, a feature of the music industry many thought to be on the wane since the late 1990s. The situation was clear, according to industry insiders: "Record companies no longer have the time, the staffing and the money to provide that infrastructure around an artist early on."[76] But it was the reasons given that were striking. Piracy barely got a parenthetical reference. The primary concern was the consolidation of the radio broadcasting and music retailing industries, which followed along the same lines as the consolidation of the music and entertainment industries. This consolidation has been widely recognized to have constricted the outlets for new and emerging artists more significantly than any other factor in this period.[77] There were simply fewer people in a smaller number of larger and more powerful corporations who decided what music made it onto the radio or which CDs made it onto the shelves of their stores or onto the pages of their websites. This meant that those larger, more powerful entities had a disproportionate influence over the rest of the market, or what those in the music industry call "market moving share."[78] If a new release was not a more or less immediate success, it was less likely that it would ever break through. Within the big record companies, consolidation meant that fewer and fewer people were available to promote, distribute, and push an increasing number of new releases. In addition to the increasing mass of music now available, there is also an increasing number of other things consumers are doing with their time and money, from seemingly infinite numbers of television channels, DVDs, video games, and websites.[79]

Remarkably, despite the seemingly profound shift to legal digital downloads, many of the same tactics and strategies persist. The fact

that the main players in the music industry have actually had some success with them is notable. Specifically, the underlying, and seemingly counterintuitive, preference of expanding the market value of a company, even if this means deliberately depressing sales numbers, is an ongoing phenomenon that does "work" at least to some limited degree. For example, when the major record labels licensed Apple to sell their catalogs through the iTunes Store starting in 2003, they still managed to maintain significant leverage despite giving up a fair amount of technological and marketing control. The leverage the dominant players in the music industry exercised was the fact that they owned all of the music Apple wanted to put up for sale. They also had almost all the artists Apple wanted to promote under contract. This leverage also took the form of the extensive and increasingly draconian legal control the music industry exerted over their music, which still gave them some semblance of influence over how that music was used by other major players in the market. The major music labels began to exercise that control a few years after the deal with Apple was completed. From the start, the big record labels complained that they weren't making enough money, despite the immediate, sustained success of the iTunes Store, and despite claiming forty-seven cents of every sale.[80] Further, the labels continually pushed for variable pricing in order to charge more for new releases and hits and to discount slower-selling tracks. Of course, there were familiar reasons for the music industry's years of nagging for variable pricing. First, and most obviously, they expected that selling some tracks for  $1.29 instead of$ 0.99 (USD) would not depress sales enough to cost them money. It looks like they were probably right.[81] As Billboard noted, "In the six weeks after iTunes introduced variable pricing . . . [c]onsumer spending on the catalog tracks dropped about 2% and net revenue to labels rose around 6%."[82] In short, the major record labels were happy to sell less music for more money to fewer people. They were also hoping that higher track prices would nudge people to buy more albums. It seems pretty clear that the bet on selling more albums did not pay off.[83] There have even been some dark mutterings about "dynamic pricing" in which prices change in real time based on some complex measurements of website usage in order to maximize "the revenue potential for [a] specific product and its demand in the marketplace."[84]

If these complex machinations seem to have a distinct ring of desperation to them, consider the fact that throughout the last century music has been immediately and intimately allied with the advent of every new major form of audiovisual media we have collectively experienced as part of a larger range of new forms of social, cultural, and economic connection. In short, what these efforts to restrict or control the flow of music should make obvious is that the music industry has been enthusiastically and aggressively "cannibalizing" itself at every turn for well over a century and has often done so with great success. The complex

dynamic interaction between the kinds of relationships enacted by the production and possession of music in some material form and those produced by experience and habit has been the underlying force in the development of nearly every form of modern media through which we consume music. Despite the manifest and seemingly insurmountable challenges to the familiar ways of doing things, important and influential players in the music industry persisted with familiar strategies of market creation and protection. However, we should not simply assume this is all they were doing. Some parts of the music industry were adapting with both speed and prescience to the emerging contours of a new world in media.

# Reality Intercedes

Given the changes in the global media landscape between the early 1980s and the present, it should not be surprising that there is another side to the familiar story of technological upheaval resulting in a dying industry. Specifically, music-based reality television and digital streaming services are two of the more instructive new forums for the experience of music that grew dramatically during this period. Importantly, both music-based reality television and digital music streaming have enacted dynamic relationships between the production and possession of music and the habitual experience of it in ways that give us important examples of how the music industry is surviving. Just as importantly, both phenomena began before the most difficult period of technological change actually hit the big players in the music industry. If we look back to the criteria for the survival of the music industry set out above, both music-based reality television and digital streaming satisfy every single one: each has been built around new alliances with different parts of the media, computer, and Internet industries; each has made piracy a marginal concern; each has sold a good deal of music that is already widely available in multiple forms; each has made profitable use of the music industry's existing intellectual property; each has reformulated the central strictures of artist contracts to manage the major cost center embodied by those actually making the music; and each has installed its own brands at the heart of the consumer experience.[85] Indeed, television shows such as American Idol, The Voice, and The X Factor provide a telling glimpse into the kinds of structural attributes and strategic alliances a "new" music industry will have to foster to survive. These programs are owned by what amounts to a management company of the sort that is hardly unprecedented in the entertainment industry. They are underwritten by investors (hailing from hedge funds most often) and survive through forging seasonal tactical and strategic alliances with specific record labels, sponsors, product lines, and television networks. From

a structural standpoint, they are very similar to those offering music streaming services. The specific ways in which both music streaming and music-based reality television have taken advantage of the larger changes in the music and entertainment industries to thrive can provide us some insight into how the music industry might survive the continuing upheaval.

First, it is important to understand that music streaming and music-based reality television were both made conceptually and economically possible by a profound change in the music industry: its evolution from an industry concerned primarily with producing and selling recorded music to an industry that is just as concerned on balance with the exploitation of intellectual property rights. In both cases, music-based reality television and music streaming created and exploited characteristic ways of managing and profiting from their enormous stores of intellectual property, which allowed both to take advantage of a global economy marked by cheap, easy-to-source labor, mobile consumption, outsourced production of content, and the exponentially increased size of their potential markets. It has been from this well-established foundation of aggressive cost and risk management suited to the specific economic circumstances I have been describing throughout this article that the sponsors of each phenomenon I am describing here have worked to successfully exploit the experience of music.

The shift to a music industry based on intellectual property management began much earlier than some might have thought. As a fairly comprehensive report from 1985 argued, in the mid-1950s "record companies bought their way into music publishing as a means of securing control over the various ancillary rights that surround a recording," and by "the end of the sixties they had become integrated to such an extent that it was impossible to untangle their activities."[86] The author then added rather presciently: "Whatever future emerges, the music industry's fate may well be determined by how successfully it manages to lobby governments on the matter of copyright reform."[87] As we now know, the industry has done this very successfully.[88] A decisive factor in this shift of focus to managing intellectual property has been the realignment of the cost and royalty structures for large swathes of the music industry. These changes have meant that the costs of licensing songs for wider use through deals with labels and artists have become increasingly fixed or, at the very least, far less flexible and therefore far more predictable and thus less risky. Controlling costs through managed negotiations and contracts is a notable aspect of both music streaming services and music-based reality television, both of which rely on mostly fixed costs as an important hedge against risk. The major costs of global franchises like American Idol and The X Factor are straightforwardly managed through comparatively formulaic types of sponsorship and traditional advertising, as well

as somewhat novel iterations of increasingly onerous artist contracts.[89] However, licensing rates for new streaming and webcasting services are increasingly being fixed through high-level negotiations between the big labels and service providers or by a statutory authority empowered by government. Thus, it is important to see how the more complicated financial issues surrounding streaming in particular have been resolved through the exertion of political clout in negotiated settlements relying on skills the music industry has honed to a lethal point in recent decades. This has been especially true in the globally influential US market.

These factors paved the way for the kinds of streaming services we commonly see today. Digital streaming was accepted both conceptually and practically within the mainstream of the music industry far earlier than is usually acknowledged. The first efforts toward creating large-scale streaming services began as early as 1994-95 with the development and diffusion of Real Network's RealAudio tools for webcasting and podcasts, as well as the all-important legal infrastructure to support widespread use of these tools.[90] As early as 1995 the music industry in the United States began crafting deals to fix the costs and set out the legal infrastructure that would allow streaming services to operate on a mass scale. This infrastructure first took shape through the Digital Performance Rights Act of 1995, which was later supplemented by the more comprehensive Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. These two laws established the first performance rights for sound recordings of any kind in the United States, a major political victory by any standard, and established the royalty collection organization SoundExchange, which began to collect and distribute money owed to the owners of sound recordings by satellite radio services and webcasters in the mid-1990s.[91] These sorts of legal mechanisms have generally been spread globally through regional and bilateral trade negotiations.

One of the main consequences of these laws was to establish the legal recognition of and distinction between two kinds of streaming services: on-demand and noninteractive.[92] On-demand services are those such as Spotify that allow users to create playlists or choose which songs to play, while noninteractive services like Pandora provide audio streams that are only broadly tailored to a user's behavior and preferences. Each type of service pays royalties to labels and artists in different ways to use their music. On-demand services require voluntary licenses negotiated directly with copyright holders, while noninteractive services must avail themselves of compulsory licenses, with rates set by a statutory authority.[93] As a condition of the compulsory license, services have to abide by a clear set of uniform parameters established in 1998 that restrict how the service provider can present music to the user.[94] Services defined as interactive have much greater latitude, but as one analyst noted, they also have much higher "transaction costs," potentially restricting this market to only a few dominant players.[95]

Perhaps the most prominent issue surrounding the introduction of the many different kinds of streaming services has been the levels of compensation paid to copyright holders and artists. Given that these payments are the streaming services' greatest costs by a wide margin, there have been protracted negotiations and legal battles between the major labels and the streaming services over these rates. These negotiations have dwarfed the negotiations over the prices for music downloads cited above in terms of both length and intensity.[96] As is often the case, the place of musicians in these new negotiated systems of power is precarious at best. As one music industry analyst reported eleven years before these issues began to make headlines, "As more contracts are being drawn in the Internet age, lawyers working on behalf of the labels have come up with more rigid and unavoidable contract clauses to hold against artists. . . . The norm has been that, with new technology, the labels try to pay the artist less. It is a strategy that saved the majors millions when CDs were introduced nearly twenty years ago."[97]

By 2001 the conceptual shift to some kind of digital streaming economy in music was widely proclaimed to be complete at last. As one Billboard analyst argued, by 2001, "in the wake of the shakeout of the venture-capital-fueled online music sector, there has emerged a more bottom-line-focused industry designed to aid and, ultimately, provide profits for media conglomerates."[98] The industry was paying enough attention to streaming and its relationship to what would eventually be called "cloud" computing to try to establish its own streaming services, which it hoped would sap the energy of increasingly robust file-sharing networks. As music industry lawyers began attacking those networks in court and lobbying for specific changes to copyright law in the US Congress and in a series of bilateral and multilateral trade deals, the big labels set about creating MusicNet, sponsored by Warner, BMG, EMI, and Real Networks, and Pressplay, sponsored by Sony and Universal. Characteristically, the music industry's focus was mostly on perpetuating the cartel-like business model described above through aggressive management of intellectual property. The failure of these services is important to understand.

The intense, dedicated, single-minded, long-term, and successful efforts that served the industry so well when remaking intellectual property law abandoned it when it set about trying to create its own streaming services. This explains the unalloyed failure of MusicNet and Pressplay when they were rolled out in 2001-2 after extensive delays and lengthy negotiations within the industry. The reasons for their failures were numerous. The first was the design and structure of both services. Both charged \(9.95 per month and allowed consumers access to a set number of streams and downloads of individual songs. However, most downloads were temporary, expiring if subscriptions lapsed. Also, there was a whole basket of restrictions about what users could and couldn't do

with the files they downloaded, and the limited catalogs made available by these services proved unattractive to potential customers.[99] Both were dismal, expensive failures. However, beyond their insufficiently flexible user interfaces, it is important to note the considerable hurdles faced by these services when they were brought out. According to one analyst, these included "tenuous consumer demand, undefined economic models, unknown costs, a lack of compelling content selection, clearance from all interested rights holders, an understanding of how to market the new services, a relationship with traditional retail, and—despite hundreds of millions of dollars of collective development spending—sustained support from the labels and their parent companies themselves."[100] From this litany of serious obstacles it is entirely reasonable to suggest that the big labels got into the digital music market too early rather than too late.

When it comes to early efforts at streaming, the music industry displayed what has to be seen as a comprehensive lack of foresight. While it is hard to blame any industry for not immediately conjuring an entirely new economy on the fly, what was really astonishing was the lengths the big record labels went to in order to create the exact same sort of cartel online that they had set up in the real world. Before either subscription service was even available to the public, the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission opened what would become very lengthy investigations into the way MusicNet and Pressplay had established themselves.[101] Smaller companies had complained that the big record labels "planned to cross-license only themselves and other major players," while others had told authorities they had been "refused licenses by MusicNet because they did not pony up hundreds of thousands of dollars for negotiations."[102] Further, major labels were accused of colluding to "set artificially high prices for digital downloads" by secretly agreeing with each other not to undercut a set price and collectively refusing to do business with anyone who didn't agree to their terms of service.[103] While the initial case was dismissed in 2003 and a similar class-action suit was also dismissed in 2008, the latter decision was reversed in 2010. This case has continued right up to the present and may yet come back to sting the big record labels.[104] The most striking feature of the accusations is that the major record labels were trying to impose abnormally high prices on digital downloads at the very time free illegal downloads were arguably at their peak. When people said at the time that the music industry "didn't get it," this is a pretty good example of what they meant. However, these halting, possibly criminal efforts were more important than their abject failure suggests. They were successful in providing models through which the music industry could establish new partnerships, alliances, and mergers with the computer industry in such a way as to protect their content and brands. It was this necessary cooperation that began to break down the music industry's

grumpy resistance to letting others sell its music online, leading to the establishment of the wildly successful iTunes Store in 2003.[105]

These kinds of selective forms of industrial cooperation began to multiply between 2003 and 2012. First, the big labels began licensing their catalogs across an increasing range of services from the many free and subscription streaming services that emerged over those years, such as Spotify, Pandora, Rdio and Rhapsody,[106] to the "bundles" of music offered with the different usage plans of mobile phone companies,[107] to allowing so-called cloud locker services offered by Amazon and Google to go forward.[108] Second, since around 2004 or so, the music industry began working to integrate its own services with those of the most used online platforms. It has defined new systems of licensing rights and distributing royalties to encourage rather than strangle new businesses that want to sell music in new ways, and it has been finding limited ways to meet tech start-ups and behemoths alike somewhere in the negotiated middle.[109] Third, the major record labels have begun to link their own digital storefronts with different social media platforms. Social media generally seem to offer the kinds of relationships with consumers that seem well suited to the exploitation of what musical experience affords people online and transform these experiences into any number of tangible transactions. For example, Facebook offers record labels what they call "a 'social graph' that represents relationships between its 700 million users and the things they care about" by measuring the kinds of relationships users have with followers by tracking the kinds of things they share, such as comments, photos, video files, or links, and how the value of what they are sharing changes over time.[110] This gives the music industry the ability to track and analyze a whole range of users' habits in order to exploit what they call "consumers' social nature."[111] As one Billboard writer noted, "If iTunes boosted digital music into low-earth orbit, Facebook can send it on a course to the moon by turning subscription services into a household product." In the near future, he predicted, "Facebook's most important gift to subscription services will be its social graph, that connective tissue that can give context to unwieldy catalogs of music as large as 15 million songs."[112] By integrating streaming or Internet radio services into social media sites, the music industry can integrate its content to users' wider online experiences and manage its relationships with them through any number of social networks, online services, and media forms. Again, we can see how the attributes of music streaming are well suited to a global economy marked by cheap, easy-to-source, "user-generated" labor that provides mobile, flexible, outsourced production of content in an exponentially increasing market to consumers who are more and more digitally accessible more of the time.

We can profitably compare more recently successful music streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora with the far more established, long-term successes of music-based reality television. Programs such as

American Idol and The X Factor have provided a seemingly obvious model for success in the music industry for quite a long time. Moreover, it has been a showy, flamboyant success that has been based on the promiscuous use of a wide range of media forms dedicated to the exploitation of what musical experience affords a mass audience. Yet for reasons that are not entirely clear, few outside of the music industry seem to have noticed. During the darkest days of the music industry, congested as they were with histrionic claims of obsolescence and decay, shows like American Idol, The Voice, and The X Factor did everything imaginable to provide a new model for the music industry.[113] They established new alliances with the television and computer industries; made piracy a practical irrelevance; turned extensive file sharing into an economic and market-building bonus; crafted multiple revenue streams that managed to share out the extensive risks of these long-running, expensive projects; cleverly used existing intellectual property to their benefit; and established their brand as the navigator of the many sales environments in which they thrived. Importantly, these shows were integrated into a range of online social media forms long before the idea was fashionable not as ancillary add-ons but as central forums for fan engagement that included voting for contestants and participating in myriad contests and so-called street team campaigns that sustained or enhanced knowledge of and interest in the shows.[114]

Beyond these comparatively philosophical attributes, they also managed to sell a lot of music and make a lot of money. Between 2001 and 2010 American Idol alone claimed to have sold 126.5 million albums, singles, and downloads, it was the top-rated television program in its timeslot for well over five years, and it had the highest advertising rates of any American television program for almost as long.[115] Spinoffs and competitors like The X Factor and The Voice, as well as music-centered dramas such as Glee, have also found sustained success by attracting large audiences and launching, or relaunching, the careers of contestants, judges, and guests alike, not to mention that little One Direction thing.[116] Yet despite the unalloyed financial success of the form, one senior music industry executive could blandly claim as late as 2011 that "television is a great opportunity. . . . We haven't innovated in the living room for many years."[117]

Not only have these programs been successful in creating a mass audience in an era defined by demographic niches, but they fit snugly into the emerging business models the music industry has been adopting, models perfectly in line with the global neoliberal model of corporate practice adopted worldwide. Music-based reality television is based on cheap, disposable, contracted labor. Musicians enter into a period of contracted servitude and serve entirely at the leisure of their employers.[118] The contestants, like their songs and performances, are more or less interchangeable, unless one of them manages to produce a hit. The contestants

are primarily a cost that is tightly controlled, while everything they produce is property to be owned and exploited by their employers and across multiple media and revenue streams.[119] Again, the parallels with music streaming services should be clear. Low-cost "user-generated" (or contestant-generated) labor provides an eminently flexible platform for the music industry's intellectual property that can then be introduced, used, and reused across an endless variety of media in an exponentially larger market than those that preceded it, all cost-effectively exploited by a fairly run-of-the-mill global franchising system. Importantly, these shows also produce the necessary illusion of "democracy" through the expertly crafted simulacrum of consequential audience agency. Despite continual claims of openness and democracy, these shows remained tightly controlled forums for the music industry to showcase itself above all else.[120]

This is where these shows teach us the most about why they present a potent model for the future of the music industry. Over the last fifteen years or so, the production and sale of tangible musical artifacts in which record labels seek out and develop musicians to help them forge long stable careers as creative artists through fan support of recordings and live performances has been gradually made the subservient but necessary corollary of the exploitation of the many new environments in which we can experience music. These new environments have been used to create brands whose experiential content can effortlessly and invisibly slip across any existing or emerging media channel and produce profit in any of the multiple guises in which they might appear. These guises, and the seemingly endless opportunities for merchandising, only seem to multiply, whether they appear as part of a live show; a one-off performance; a soundtrack to a film, television show, or advertisement; a promotional appearance; a television or film documentary; a fictional film; or a television miniseries. In fact, one largely overlooked result of the turmoil in the music industry since 1999 has been that the range of tie-ins a record company might be able to link to an artist has become unfathomably wide. As one group of economists recently argued, record companies have long sought "product line extensions, including downloadable music, cellphone ring tones, ringback tones (snippets of music that play to callers while they wait for their call to go through), cellphone wallpaper, music embedded in video games, DJ remixes, and numerous other offshoots. One source estimates that more than four hundred different items might be offered in connection with a specific album."121

It should be reasonably clear that contemporary music-based reality television is part of a long tradition of the multimedia exploitation of musical performance and merchandising. Aspects of music-based reality television practice stretch back to the first radio stars using their considerable media savvy to link newly intimate forms of microphone singing to the passionate attachment of fans through a coordinated range of new

media such as weekly radio shows, glossy magazines, merchandise, and sound recordings.[122]

The producers of music-based reality television programs have spent over a decade polishing their considerable abilities to exploit the musical affordances their shows construct since the first of their contemporary permutations appeared in 1999.[123] Every imaginable musical moment or gesture is itself part of a larger, more encompassing brand. The songs, performances, celebrity guest appearances, and advice and admonitions of the judges are stitched together as part of a constant, breathless narrative of dreams, drama, success, and failure. This narrative shapes the substantial range of aesthetic materials on offer into continuously available brand-building opportunities for all involved.

The main economic attribute of selling tangible artifacts for some parts of the music industry is that music can then become so much low-cost, low-risk grist for the ever-expanding mill of mediated social experience. The logic of this model demands that music must be not so much rationed as economically directed and purposefully exploited in all of its many potential incarnations. The music industry is using streaming and music-based reality television to aggressively manage the costs and risks of increasingly large, accessible, complex, and unruly markets, to develop new and profitable parts of an industry increasingly focused on intellectual property exploitation, to link itself meaningfully into other industries and the social networks managed by them, and to incorporate the experience of music and social connections it affords people into a larger landscape of economic exploitation. While the claims that the music industry was "dying" persisted for far longer than one might think necessary, the increasingly apparent consequence of the digital "revolution" in music has been the ever-more-secure incorporation of the experience of music into the larger schemas of neoliberal globalization.

# Conclusion: Shoulda, Woulda, Coulda

When album sales began their decline in 2001, many music industry analysts and observers were absolutely certain that the big players in the popular music industry had blown it. The general consensus stated that the major record labels should have made a deal with Napster in 2001, which would have lured in millions of loyal users who could have spent billions on legal downloads.[124] For many, the ramifications of the music industry's lack of vision seemed clear. In early 2011 an authoritative article written by a senior editor at the New York Times claimed that the market in digital music "may already be as big as it is going to get," with "growth in digital revenue slowing nearly to a standstill."[125] Based on various industry sources and consultants, the author predicted that sales of digital music would top out at less than $5 billion. By the end

of 2012, however, that market had surpassed \(5.6 billion, a modest but solid expansion. More importantly, this increase in sales volume was an important part of that rarest of rarities, more than two years of increased revenues for the global music industry. Further, because of its extremely uneven global reach, the digital music market was still largely confined to a small number of wealthy countries such as the United States and the UK as of 2013. This is especially true of music streaming and cloud locker services, and even in the countries in which these services are most established, they still made up only small percentages of the total music market.[126] Three years later, one music market research firm, with all the retrospective clarity it could muster, predicted that music companies would experience several more years of economic pain and that musicians would ease into a stable music market dominated by a small number of streaming businesses.[127] In short, given the perceived potential upside of a still-nascent digital market, a faint glow of optimism emanated from quarters long known to be utterly bereft of the stuff. It has proven extremely difficult if not foolhardy to predict the future of these markets and to determine whether this subtle breath of hope is a sudden intake of air or some sort of terminal exhale. What is relevant here is assessing what preceded this apparent but ambiguous and fragile recovery.

What this article has hopefully demonstrated is that what preceded the mild, comparative cheer of 2012-13 was more than a decade of confusion, conflict, and economic pain that was arguably unprecedented in the history of the modern music industry. Underneath the spectacle of an industry appearing to consume itself is a more subtle dynamic that I have tried to set out here. I have tried to definitively link the key determinants of a complex political economy that can help us trace the intentions, actions, and influence of those who have the technological, political, and economic power to exploit the broader developments of our collective music culture. One of my main goals here has been to build on existing understandings of this political economy to show how seemingly novel expressions of this dynamic can be more comprehensively understood not just as the death rattle of a once-powerful industry but as a driving force of a particularly brutal realignment of the underlying dynamics of that industry's relationship to the broader society.

120. Fairchild, Pop Idols, chaps. 6 and 7. Here I show how the main point of  $\text{Idol}$  has been to present to its audience the process of making a pop star and to do so in minute detail. The show uses recording industry executives and veterans to provide guidance and display their knowledge and influence. They also spend a lot of their air time telling amateur performers how to make it in the industry by looking, sounding, and acting the "right way." The eventual winner is the living proof that the music industry works.

123. As a point of clarification, the first of these shows was Popstars, which started in New Zealand in 1999. Its similarities to the Idol and The X Factor franchises are notable. Please see David McNikel, "TrueBliss Flies onto NZ Charts via TV Program," *Billboard* 111 (1999): 93, 116.
