Spotify Teardown is possibly the most comprehensive study about the streaming giant that you can get your hands on today. The five authors from Sweden, along with their technical computing group from the HUMlab at the Umeå University, is perhaps the top team of experts in the world with the credentials and enough insight to write an academic book on the inner working of streaming music and the policy implications related to those services. It is based on a $1 million study funded by the Swedish Research Council to investigate and challenge the quid pro quo of streaming services such as Spotify. The study ran from Fall 2013 to Summer 2017 and yielded an impressive twenty-one top peer-reviewed articles! The book is a hybrid between a dissertation and a compilation of academic articles but do not let this dissuade you from reading it. To my surprise, it was a really fast and entertaining read.

The book revolves around four chapters. The first offers a fascinating historical time line narrative following the nine rounds of financing the company had to secure to survive, pivoting its business model all along the way. It tracks how Spotify evolved from its Beta years as a peer-to-peer, Pirate Bay-like model, to the platform we know today. The second chapter explains how music files are loaded onto the platform and the inner working of aggregators. The third one follows how the streaming company aggregates playlists. Finally, the fourth and last chapter (and perhaps the most illuminating one in my opinion) delves inside the automation process of its programmatic advertising system and the roles of its various intermediaries. Mind blowing! But I think that the best parts of this book are the various experiments the team produced, which are interjected throughout the manuscript and called "interventions". The team of researchers created some of the most innovative and out-of-the-box thinking methodologies I have seen in a long time. They developed and used bots, scripts, and crawlers to discover the inner workings of the Spotify platform. Some of those experiments involved creating a record label to understand the mechanics of aggregators, using bots for tracking streams, developing a plug-in called Songblocker (the opposite of an ad-blocker) to sniff out the

communication between Spotify and its ad suppliers, and tracking playlist loops generated by Spotify Radio.

If there is any shortcoming to the book, it is perhaps that it is directed to the academic community rather than the general population. Because of this, the narrative includes a certain amount of redundancy as the authors keep bringing us back to what was discussed previously as an introduction to each new section. Also, this is most definitely not a read for your freshman class or your survey of the music business course. However, it would make an amazing case study to use in a special topics course or independent study, it could be used in a music industry seminar (skipping the research methodology and research design parts), or it could be prescribed to graduate students involved in research methods.

Reading Spotify Teardown, you will learn more about Spotify and the inner workings of streaming services such as Spotify than you ever wanted to know, but it is hands down the best music business-related book I have read in a long time.
