# 1 Introduction

In her chapter entitled "Is Classical Music a Living or Heritage Art Form?" (italicized by the author), Eastburn (2018) brings to the forefront a crucial issue about the future of classical music. At the heart of this discussion is the fraught debate concerning the claim of "the death of classical music." The debate between Norman Lebrecht and Alex Ross illustrates this contentious topic: Lebrecht, known for his controversial views in the classical music world, wrote a figurative obituary for the

genre (Lebrecht 2007). Ross, in contrast, offers a counterargument by looking at the increase in new releases and sales data from the 1990s to the 2000s, consequently leading to his claim that "classical recording is bigger than ever" (Ross 2007).

Revisiting Eastburn's investigation into whether classical music is a living or heritage art form necessitates a reevaluation of the rigid, disparate categories into which cultural inheritances are forced to fit. Eastburn's framing of the question introduces a dualistic scheme that confines classical music to a static period in the past, neglecting its dynamic, evolving nature and overlooking its potential for adaptation and innovation.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) describes "living heritage" as an intangible cultural heritage that is "inherited from our ancestors and passed on to our descendants. It includes oral traditions, performing arts, social practices, rituals and festive events, knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe, and knowledge and skills related to craftsmanship. It is continuously recreated as transmitted from generation to generation and evolves in response to our environment." Classical music, situated within the realm of performing arts, aligns seamlessly with this definition, particularly with the inheritance from the great works of Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Mahler, and many others, as well as its attribute of being "continuously recreated." The challenge and opportunity lies in how classical music can be reinterpreted and revitalized in harmony with contemporary societal and cultural contexts, thereby ensuring its preservation as a "living heritage."

In her paper "Exploring Living Heritage Conservation," Adriana Trujillo refines the definition of "living heritage" as "cultural practices, traditions, and values that continue to have meaning for generations of people as individuals and communities" (2019). She quotes Kimball et al. (2013) to emphasize that living heritage is meant to be altered and added to so that its protection is not just about holding onto the past as the "golden days" and trying to preserve as much of the past as possible but should also be viewed through a transformative approach that ensures its meaningful continuity. This perspective helps us understand the importance of the "continuous recreation" of classical music, such that the protection of classical music as a living heritage is not limited to the preservation of works by great composers from hundreds of years ago; it is equally important to encourage the continual composition of new classical music for the contemporary era.

Therefore, the ongoing performance of canonical classical compositions and the continual creation and presentation of new works within the genre are crucial for maintaining classical music as a vibrant, living heritage. It moves us beyond mere preservation or honoring historical performance and leads musicians to the domain of composing in homage to classical music's historical figures while also transforming the genre. Continuous re-creation also acknowledges the central role of new music in classical music's ecosystem, ensuring that classical music remains relevant to contemporary listeners and acknowledging culturally relevant themes, narratives, and technological advances.

Ellen T. Harris and Michael Beckerman argue that "the intrinsic value of classical music lies rather in its continual reimagining" (2021). However, what exactly is the "intrinsic value" of classical music? What is the value of something that no longer commands widespread attention? Although some may hold firm that classical music is essentially "better" than pop music (Young 2016), I prefer to address these questions in a different direction. To begin with, it is vital to recognize the intrinsic value of diversity, not only in biodiversity and sociodiversity but also, by extension, in art and music diversity. Baum and Owe conclude that "[b]iodiversity and sociodiversity get almost all the attention, but perhaps there is a case for attention to other types of diversity as well" (2024). Accordingly, the flourishing of a particular music genre enhances the appreciation and enjoyment of other genres. For instance, Debussy's compositions were enriched by Japanese and Chinese music, just as some of The Beatles' music integrated traditional Indian music, subsequently influencing Indian pop music. Without the foundation of classical music, modern pop works such as Eric Carmen's All by Myself, based on Sergei Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto (Op. 18), or Little Mix's Little Me, which draws from Gabriel Faure's Pavane (Op. 50), would not exist. Similarly, the soundtracks by John Williams and Hans Zimmer frequently draw on classical music themes and techniques.

The evolution of classical music in the West coincides with significant historical developments—from Gregorian chant and the secularization of music during the late medieval and Renaissance periods to the humanism of the Enlightenment and the intellectual movements of Modernism, connecting with other art forms, philosophy, science, poetry, literature, and religious practices. Listening to classical music connects us to the intellectual and spiritual development of humanity, offering profound emotional depth, spiritual intensity, intellectual rigor, and evocative aesthetics that are often elusive in more popular genres today. As Julian Johnson argues in *Who Needs Classical Music*, the nature of classical music as an "art" differs fundamentally from other types of music that serve primarily for entertainment or background noise (Johnson 2002). Thus, preserving classical music as a living heritage is of significant importance.

Viewing classical music as a "living heritage art form" provides a nuanced notion of bridging the gap between tradition and progress. It acknowledges the deep foundational roots of classical music within the ways that all forms of world heritage are constructed, but it also recognizes classical music as progressive and relevant within the modern cultural context. Such a framework highlights the genre's ability to preserve its core aesthetic values and historical significance while enriching the contemporary cultural landscape through innovative compositions, performance practices, and cross-genre collaborations. This reconceptualization makes classical music more dynamic and permeable to heterogeneous audiences, thereby nurturing its sustainability in an ongoing process of renewal and reshaping.

To sustain classical music as a living tradition, not a relic, we need to foster environments that encourage the performance of the great masterpieces of the bygone eras while simultaneously nurturing the creation of new compositions, which can be achieved by promoting the value of innovation within the classical music tradition through educational programs, supporting contemporary composers who want to challenge the conventions of the genre, and cultivating audiences who are receptive

to both old and contemporary classical music. It is also essential to demystify classical music, making it more user-friendly to a wider audience by integrating it into new media and accessible public settings. Embracing classical music as a living heritage presents daunting challenges. From socio-cultural shifts to economic and technological changes, various factors influence how classical music is perceived, consumed, and supported. The challenges confronting the field include diversity, popularization, and financial viability.

# 2 Scope of analysis

This paper will examine the traditional business practice of the world of classical music in North America, including statistics on concert attendance, issues of equity and diversity, and the inclusion of North American orchestras. It will also contrast them with the practice of European and Asian orchestras to examine the factors of limitation of this art form in the 21st century. This paper will explore the public image challenges of classical music in North America, especially among the younger generation, in terms of competing with other music genres, such as pop and rock, and the lack of coverage of classical music in mainstream media. Another challenge to the sustainability of classical music in the West is the financial model associated with the performances in the concert halls, in addition to the costs of administration, tour, maintenance of the performance venues, salaries of musicians, and so on. The paper will further examine the dynamics between arts organizations and their patrons. It will then offer some suggestions on how classical music can remain active on the stage, not as a heritage of the past that has become lifeless like the artifacts in the museum, but as a “living heritage” that can still be engaged with a new audience and inspire them with continuous new compositions that are relevant to the contemporary societies.

# 3 Discussion

# 3.1 Challenge I: diversity

Classical music remains a viable, relevant, and pressing genre within modern society; however, it faces a significant challenge due to prevailing public perceptions. Often seen in North America and Europe as a symbol of "Caucasian male elitism," classical music is frequently associated with the broader framework of Western cultural hegemony. Even with the introduction of "diversity initiatives" in recent years, Kristina Kolbe argues that such efforts can become socially commodified, ultimately reinforcing existing power structures. According to Kolbe, these initiatives often perpetuate hegemonic power relations of race, ethnicity, and class by utilizing the appearance of multicultural inclusion as a means to reaffirm the dominance of "the white highbrow" culture as the primary site of cultural and social legitimacy; consequently, rather than dismantling exclusionary norms, these efforts may serve to maintain the status quo (Kolbe 2021). In an era prioritizing equity, diversity,

and inclusion, this stereotypical image links classical music to White supremacy, misogyny, and exclusivity. This stereotype also hints at conservatism and nostalgia, reflecting a desire to revert to the golden era of musical artistry of bygone times. Consequently, classical music struggles to resonate with a diverse audience, which raises significant questions regarding the relevance of classical music in the context of the 21st century's progressive values and easily leads to concerns that preserving the genre as a living heritage may inadvertently perpetuate notions of "Caucasian male elitism."

In terms of its practice, Feder and McGill elucidate the underrepresentation of Black and Latinx musicians in the classical music sphere because of access barriers and structural racism (Feder and McGill, 2021). They further delineate the challenges classical music institutions face in addressing such structural racism and unconscious bias, advocating for the enhancement of opportunities for people of color in aspects such as employment, tenure achievement, and audition participation. Correspondingly, Michael Cooper remarks that American orchestras rank among "the least racially diverse institutions" (2018). As delineated in the "Racial/Ethnic and Gender Diversity in the Orchestra Field in 2023: A Report by the League of American Orchestras," the composition of orchestras predominantly features White musicians, constituting over  $79\%$  of the orchestra demographic. In contrast, Hispanic/Latinx musicians represent a mere  $4.8\%$ , Black musicians  $2.4\%$ , Asian musicians  $11\%$ , and American Indian and Alaska Native People, along with Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island People, collectively account for only  $0.3\%$  (Cuyler et al. 2023). This pattern of underrepresentation extends to conductors, music directors, staff members, top executives, and board members, indicating a systemic issue within the orchestral field. Although gender disparity exists, balance is seen among board members and top executives. However, only  $11.1\%$  of music directors are women; the remaining  $88.9\%$  are men. While the report does not explicitly address the status of queer composers and performers, individuals within the  $\mathrm{LGBTQ + }$  community have experienced increased acceptance over the past decade. This shift has given rise to several initiatives, including the Florida Orchestra's Pride Weekend and the Queer Urban Orchestra in New York City (Solomon 2019).

In contrast to North America, orchestras in many Asian countries do not confront the same challenges regarding equity, diversity, and inclusion. As a result, the issue of “Caucasian male elitism” is not as pronounced in these contexts. While Western classical music may still carry connotations of prestige, it is not as deeply entwined with issues of racial and class exclusivity in many Asian societies. A notable example is Singapore, with a population of five million people comprising  $74.0\%$  Chinese,  $13.5\%$  Malay,  $9.0\%$  Indian, and  $3.4\%$  categorized as “Others” (Department of Statistics Singapore 2023). Orchestras in Singapore, such as the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, the Singapore Chinese Orchestra, the Orkestra Melayu, and the Singapore Indian Orchestra and Choir, play a dual role: they represent the nation’s “domestic and multicultural aspects at the state level, as well as inter-Asian solidarity against ‘Western’ hegemonies encountered in the journey towards attaining” (Tan 2017). In addition to being musical entities, these institutions carry social and political responsibilities, showcasing Singapore’s cultural and artistic achievements on the international stage and facilitating cultural cohesion among its ethnically diverse

population to promote active citizenship. The commitment to multicultural integration within these orchestras is further exemplified by their inclusive programming, which explores Chinese, Malay, and Indian traditional folk music and pop music in addition to the standard jazz and Western classical music genres.

Orchestras in China's mainland tend to consist primarily of musicians of Chinese descent. The situation in the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra (HKPhil) is quite different, complicated by the region's British colonial history before 1997 and its lingering legacy. Unlike its mainland counterpart, HKPhil has a more diverse composition of musicians. It has significantly enhanced its international stature over the past two decades under the leadership of Edo de Waart and Jaap van Zweden. HKPhil was named the Orchestra of the Year at the 2019 Gramophone Classical Music Awards for its live recordings of Richard Wagner's complete Ring Cycle. Established as a Sino-British chamber orchestra in 1947, HKPhil is the first Asian orchestra to receive this prestigious award. The orchestra's website, however, reveals that only  $55.2\%$  of its musicians are of Chinese descent, whereas  $44.8\%$  are White, predominantly in the brass section.[2] This ratio starkly contrasts with Hong Kong's demographic, of which only  $0.8\%$  of the total population is White as of 2021.[3] In comparison, the Hong Kong Sinfonietta, founded in 1990 by local music graduates, comprises only  $10.9\%$  White musicians. Hong Kong Sinfonietta prides itself on "[thriving] on its strong local roots combined with an ambitious international vision," aiming to nurture the public interest in classical music in Hong Kong.[4]

Suzanne Yanko, founder and chief editor of *Classic Melbourne*, who previously served as a broadcaster in Hong Kong for the classical music station RTHK Radio 4 in the early 2000s, made an interesting observation of HKPhil's 2017 tour performance in Melbourne:

As they filed onto the stage, the first thing I noticed was the international look of the orchestra, with the brass section in particular having gleaned (male) players from Europe. Perhaps I remembered things differently, but in the past, the HKPO had the look of a local ensemble, apart from the odd Australian or British player. Ironically, the orchestra was in Australia as part of an ambitious five-city international tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. But, under the baton of Jaap van Zweden, the interest was, of course, in the sound, not the ethnic makeup of the group. Having said that, the first item Quintessence was by a Chinese composer, Fung Lam, the first Hong Kong composer to be commissioned by the BBC.[5]

Yanko suspects that the makeup of the musicians of HKPhil under Jaap van Zwerden's direction reflects a deliberate choice, prioritizing the orchestra's sonic profile

over demographic representation, resulting in a higher proportion of White musicians than that in the early 2000s. An interview with Meg Sterling, Principal Flautist at HKPhil, further reveals that “[m]any of the players of Asian background are actually from America or Europe; Chinese-American, Korean-American, or they have studied abroad from a young age. The official language of the orchestra is English. There is an excellent feeling in the orchestra, and everyone is friendly and gets along well.”6 According to Sterling, despite the minority status of White musicians in Hong Kong, the orchestra embodies a Western cultural orientation and maintains friendliness among its members.

Besides the demographic issues in North American orchestras, classical music is generally perceived as being linked to elitism and perpetuating racial, economic, and social inequalities. Kolbe (2022) undertakes an ethnographic investigation of a diversity initiative in a German opera house over an extended period by using ethnographic methods and interviews. This inquiry offers a detailed understanding of how discourses of diversity are incorporated into production. By thoroughly analyzing how classical music has been compromised due to its historical role in underpinning elitist and exclusionary structures, Kolbe's study offers a compelling critique that calls for a reform of established conventions regarding the societal role of classical music. The study also examines how power dynamics related to race and ethnicity influence processes of commissioning, composition, and rehearsal, as well as the extent to which highly visible racialized differences can be challenged and reshaped.

Tommasini's (2020) advice about purposely considering race and gender in auditions has sparked a broader debate about affirmative action in college admissions, an effort to enhance diversity that was recently contested before the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court ruled in June 2023 against affirmative action admissions policies used by Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, finding that they violated the U.S. Constitution's equal protection clause. This decision has caused us to wonder about the legal viability of similar strategies in orchestral auditions. Perhaps addressing diversity in orchestras will involve more than altering the audition process but enhancing accessibility to classical training for Black and Latinx individuals, such as offering scholarships or grants to support travel for auditions so that talent in these communities has the chance to be recognized and developed while keeping the blind audition process intact. Such measures aim to expand the "pipeline" of musicians from underrepresented communities so that orchestral music's diversity and inclusion will be a part of its future.

The lack of racial and gender diversity in classical music has significant negative consequences. Not only is this harmful to BIPOC and female musicians, but it also perpetuates the perception of the classical music sector as an exclusive, White, old boys' club. This perception conflicts with the modern values of diversity and inclusivity that society generally prioritizes. The looming representation of classical music alienates possible audience members and emerging artists who may perceive

classical music as lacking the reflection of their social or cultural experiences, rendering it inaccessible. Classical music is, therefore, at risk of becoming irrelevant and unappealing in a world that is becoming increasingly diversified. This challenge extends beyond moral obligations and stretches to the strategic necessity of upholding the sustainability of classical music as an art form.

Research indicates that similar challenges within the opera world persist, reflecting broader issues of representation and access (Guachalla 2017). However, numerous Asian soloists, such as Yundi Li, Seong-Jin Cho, Haochen Zhang, and Yu-Chien Tseng, have gained considerable popularity and emerged as top-selling musicians in the classical recording industry. These rising stars, who have won prestigious international music competitions, demonstrate the high level of artistic achievement attained by Asian musicians in a domain historically dominated by Caucasian performers. Their success suggests a shift in the cultural landscape, where Asian musicians have proven themselves to be equally accomplished. Nonetheless, some classical soloists, such as the South Korean pianist Kun-Woo Paik, remain more recognized in Asian markets. Paik's recordings with major labels such as Decca and EMI were initially restricted to regional distribution but have gained broader international accessibility owing to the increasing globalization of music through digital platforms. The marketing strategies surrounding Asian classical musicians may also reveal underlying socio-cultural hierarchies prevalent in Western markets.

# 3.2 Challenge II: popularization

Numerous challenges have been said to confront the classical music industry, ranging from poorly attended concert halls in North America to the alarming report by Billboard that even top-selling classical recordings rarely sold over 100 copies in a week. In the pre-pandemic era, Melia Tourangeau, the chief executive of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, mentioned in an interview that it was a hopeless jubilation to be "happy" and "jumping up and down" to celebrate selling over 1,000 tickets in the 2,700-seat Heinz Hall. Other classical music ensembles, such as the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, mentioned on their websites that they estimated crowds of  $70 - 75\%$  capacity for their respective venues. In addition, the audience for classical music performances has predominantly been composed of older individuals, a trend observed since at least 2005. This pattern is further illustrated by instances where shopping malls, bus stations, convenience stores, and car parks have resorted to "weaponizing" classical music as a sonic deterrent to loitering youths (Thompson 2017). These observations not only suggest that classical music's appeal is rarely found among younger generations but also indicate a potential decline of the genre with the passing of this demographic. This hypothesis appears to glean empirical support from Statista, which documents

a decline in the proportion of adults in the U.S. attending at least one classical music event annually, from  $13\%$  in 1982 to  $8.8\%$  in 2012.[9].

In the face of the evident decline and obstacles confronting its industry, classical music continues to occupy a significant place in the global musical landscape. According to the 2022 Bachtrack Annual Statistics report, 27,124 classical music performances—consisting of concerts, operas, and ballets—were documented in the U.S., the United Kingdom, and various European countries. While down by  $20\%$  from the pre-pandemic number of 34,648 events, this figure indicates a possible resurgence of the industry after a pandemic-induced dip<sup>10</sup>, suggesting that it is still precipitous to declare the “death” of classical music or to regard it as a “heritage art form.”

The perpetual production of new compositions within the realm of classical music not only serves as a testament to its liveliness and pertinence but also illustrates its ability to modify itself and progress with the times. Additionally, modern tendencies and preferences have caused an increase in cross-genre collaborations, which allow classical music to transcend its traditional domain and infiltrate the contemporary music industry, becoming an integral part of film scores, television series soundtracks, and video game music. This evolution signifies a transformation, which indicates that while the established model of the classical music sector may be on a decline, a new paradigm is emerging. Classical music lends itself to arduously redefining its scope and future by continuously involving new mediums and engaging with new genres. The emerging model is evidence of the way the genre of classical music has demonstrated adaptability and resilience in an era of profound shifts in cultural norms and consumption patterns. Classical music remains a dynamic and evolving art form, contributing to the broader societal culture in diverse and expansive ways. It is essential for the classical music industry that the impending change in its media platform is being met with constant attention to questions of technology, access, and priorities of the music profession.

Alexandra Kertz-Welzel's critique interrogates how contemporary music education paradigms construct classical music and students' personal experiences as incommensurate. She analyzes the deep-seated biases that generate widespread anticlassicism, problematizing the simple narratives so often presented in education. Kertz-Welzel's analysis not only points to issues of equity and inclusivity within the classical music industry but also registers a more significant gulf that has opened up between classical music and contemporary youth, who so often find the traditional, aesthetic, and narratives of classical music irrelevant and unappealing (Kertz-Welzel 2021). This gulf is made glaringly apparent by, on the one hand, the use of classical music in shopping malls to deter loitering youths and, on the other, the "sea of gray hair" that characterizes the audience at a typical classical concert in North America.

The challenge of engaging with classical music is further compounded by the 21st -century lifestyle characterized by constant distractions, the expectation of multitasking, and a predilection for the short-duration content epitomized by internet platforms like TikTok. The Policy Institute and the Centre for Attention Studies (2022) highlight a reduction in the attention span of younger generations, which makes the prospect of enduring a 40-minute symphony or a 3-hour opera particularly daunting. The themes of moral conflict, nationalism, and mythical narratives that pervade these centuries-old compositions are also found to be alien and irrelevant to modern sensibilities. In addition, the sophisticated musical aesthetics of Baroque counterpoint or Classical Sonata forms, and the abstract nature of absolute music may seem overly complex or rigid to those accustomed to the straightforward, lyrically explicit nature of pop music.

A comprehensive education in the history, period styles, harmony, and counterpoint of classical music compositions provides a solid foundation for a nuanced appreciation and enjoyment of the genre. However, this commitment to learning requires significant time and effort. This situation raises critical questions about the value of classical music and whether the extensive education required to appreciate what some may consider an "outdated" genre is justified. It is suggested that classical music education must be structured around four core areas: specialized conservatory training for aspiring professional musicians; comprehensive music study for students who incorporate classical music as a fundamental aspect of their academic development; the integration of music into the general curriculum at K-12 educational levels; and music education facilitated by arts organizations and cultural institutions, including the provision of program notes, pre-concert discussions, and related activities. These four pillars are essential for fostering a robust "classical music culture," which is critical for ensuring the long-term sustainability of this art form (Beckerman, Guzelimian, et al. 2021). Ensuring its continued relevance and significance in the world necessitates educators reforming pedagogical strategies. By doing so, students can engage with the genre on a deeper and more personally connected level, recognizing its complexity, splendor, and importance. This approach not only broadens the accessibility of classical music but also enriches students' cultural and artistic understanding, fostering a lifelong appreciation for this timeless genre.

Furthermore, the social dynamics of peer pressure play a significant role in deterring young individuals from embracing an affinity for classical music. Les Dreyer, former violinist with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, indicated that the decline in the audience of classical music is partly due to "the increased media focus on rock and pop superstars" and "the reduction or outright cancellation of Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic tours and concerts in the parks."[11] However, the estrangement from classical music extends beyond the current Generation Z and traces its origins to the preceding generation, the parents of today's Gen Z, who

were raised amid the ascendancy of rock and pop music. The resultant double-gen- erational distancing presents a compounded challenge in reconciling these divergent musical inclinations and reintegrating classical music into the broader fabric of contemporary cultural consumption.

Another set of barriers to bringing classical music to the general public lies in the dearth of mainstream media guidance on appreciating this art form. Zachary Woolfe and Alex Ross have indicated a stark decline in the presence of classical music criticism within prominent media outlets, noting that "[i]n America, fewer than 10 newspapers now have a full-time classical music critic on staff: a couple of generations ago, the number was in the dozens" (2021). The reduction in specialized music writing represents not only a diminishment in concert reviews but also the further depletion of opportunities for public education in the nuances and standards of classical music performance.

Public exposure to and appreciation of classical music suffer tangible consequences from the decline of media coverage and critique. For instance, the widespread acclaim and welcome afforded to Van Cliburn as a national hero following his victory at the first International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1958—complete with a ticker-tape parade in New York City and a cover feature in Time Magazine—contrasts sharply with the relatively muted media response to George Li's Silver Prize win at the same competition in 2015. These differences in coverage indicate the marginalization of classical music from the cultural mainstream and, by extension, the importance of media in cultivating interest and engagement in this art form. The role of media in shaping public perceptions and interests is critical; therefore, the diminution of coverage of classical music effectively sidelines the genre, limiting its visibility and accessibility to potential audiences. As Zachary Woolfe, the current classical music critic at The New York Times, notes, "Music criticism has always been a limited affair: writing about music, talking about music, is far wider in scope, and more essential to musical life than many people realize." (Woolfe and Ross 2021).

# 3.3 Challenge III: financial viability

The financial sustainability of classical music institutions represents another significant challenge, reflecting the insurmountable annual costs associated with maintaining orchestras, opera houses, and classical concert halls. These expenses encompass a broad range of financial obligations, from the salaries of tenured musicians and professional executives to the maintenance of concert venues and the costs of transporting musicians for performances. The financial viability of these institutions is under constant threat, as evidenced by numerous reports of financial crises impacting venerable arts organizations.

Economic status may influence music preferences. Individuals from more affluent backgrounds "have more opportunities to visit cultural institutions and events such as museums, concerts, and theaters, and thus, tend to have more knowledge and appreciation of highbrow culture" (Liu, Hu, and Schedl 2018). Following this argument, the global economic recession caused by COVID-19 lockdowns and the high

inflation rate after the pandemic substantially affected the entertainment and art sectors, including the classical music industry.

A recent example is the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony in Ontario, Canada, which filed for bankruptcy in September 2023 after enduring years of financial struggle. The symphony, which was 78 years old at the time, cited a significant asset deficiency as the primary cause of its insolvency when donation revenues in 2022 recovered to only half of the prepaidemic levels (Lee 2023). In addition, subscriber numbers plummeted from 8,000 to 2,000. However, this is not an isolated instance but part of a troubling trend within the industry. The bankruptcy and subsequent dissolution of the 83-year-old San Antonio Symphony in 2022 left San Antonio, Texas, the largest American city without a major orchestra. Similarly, the Philadelphia Orchestra, one of the Big Five orchestras in the U.S., filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and has since been engaged in rebuilding efforts. Other notable examples include the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which canceled its summer season in 2018; the Gotham Chamber Opera, which announced its closure in 2015; and the New York City Opera, which declared bankruptcy in 2013. These examples highlight the vulnerability of classical music organizations; sustainable financial models are necessary to ensure the long-term viability of these cultural assets, many of which are close to a century old.

This pattern of financial distress is not unique to any region but is a phenomenon observed across many North American cities, indicating a pervasive challenge within the classical music industry. The Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra (CPO), Canada's fifth-largest orchestra, is a noteworthy example of an institution that faced financial peril, seeking bankruptcy protection in 2002. However, the CPO managed not only to survive this period of financial instability but also to emerge more robust, with a refined vision and strategic focus that has solidified its market position. Through collaboration with professional firms, the CPO could harness expertise in strategic planning, project management, fundraising, legal assistance, market research, governance, branding, public relations, financial and human resource management support (Finley, Gralen, et al. 2006). This comprehensive approach to rebuilding and restructuring has allowed the CPO to thrive in the years following its financial crisis.

Similarly, the 79-year-old New Mexico Symphony Orchestra, which declared bankruptcy in 2011, underwent a transformation that led to the establishment of the New Mexico Philharmonic. This rebirth marked a significant turnaround, with the Philharmonic becoming the state's flagship classical music organization. By performing for more than 40,000 audience members each season, the New Mexico Philharmonic has become an integral part of New Mexico's cultural landscape. These examples underscore the potential for classical music institutions to recover from financial adversity through strategic planning, community engagement, and innovative management practices.

Robert J. Flanagan's study indicates that orchestras in smaller cities often struggle with higher structural deficits than those in larger cities. Flanagan suggests several fiscal strategies to address the financial crises orchestras face in the U.S. These include enhancing performance revenues, partially through more significant ticket-price differentiation, reducing the growth of expenses by making the pay of

orchestra musicians responsive to changes in the financial balance of orchestras, and raising nonperformance income through tax incentives for private contributions and drawing earnings on endowment investments. Flanagan emphasizes that “[c] ontinual policy innovations that variously raise performance and nonperformance revenues and reduce expenses are necessary to counter the ongoing growth of structural deficits.” (Flanagan 2012).

In an environment characterized by rapid changes in audience behaviors and the public's engagement with and support for the performing arts, the classical music field is contending with evolving ticket-buying patterns, including declines in subscriptions and single ticket sales. This scenario highlights the challenges many orchestras and concert halls face in staying solvent as traditional revenue streams experience a downturn. With classical music organizations witnessing shrinking box office revenues and becoming increasingly dependent on donations, finding innovative survival strategies has become imperative. Music program directors now find themselves in a tenuous spot, searching for the support needed to continue their artistic endeavors. Such changes demand a corresponding increase in reliance on philanthropy and sponsorship, which now constitute a growing portion of these organizations' budgets (VanBesien 2021). The decline in public funding sources is particularly concerning for orchestras in the U.S., which rely heavily on private funding. According to Flanagan's analysis, public subsidies account for only  $5\%$  of orchestras' annual expenses in the U.S., whereas orchestras in Europe and Australia receive  $20 - 90\%$  of their expenses from public sources (Flanagan 2012) and are more financially stable. European orchestras, and surprisingly orchestras in Canada too (McGrath, Legoux and Sénécal 2017), benefit from substantial government support, whereas Asian orchestras often employ a hybrid funding model that combines government support with private funding (Salvaggio 2024). In 2017, the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal (OSM) in Canada, for example, received an extra $7.5 million of financial assistance over 5 years in addition to the $8.8 million annual funding it receives from the Quebec government,[12] making it the orchestra with the highest state funding in North America. In the U.S., government support for orchestras is provided through funding from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), which 2024 awarded a total of $2,616,100 to 97 orchestras. This amount is merely one-third of the additional funding the OSM received in 2017. Each orchestra receives $15,000-$50,000, depending on the needs indicated in its grant applications.[13] Despite this support, there were attempts to defund the NEA in 2023. Although these amendments were defeated by a vote in the House of Representatives, the program's budget was still reduced by  $10\%$  from the previous year.[14]

The dynamics between arts organizations and their patrons have also become increasingly complicated. Donors often demand evidence-based outcomes for their contributions. This expectation can sometimes put program directors or music executives in a difficult position as they struggle to maintain their artistic vision while catering to their patrons' musical tastes and social values. This balancing act is crucial for securing the resources necessary to maintain the core artistic work of these institutions relevant in a swiftly changing cultural and financial environment.

# 3.4 What can be done?

Counteracting the dwindling interest in classical music necessitates innovative approaches to its presentation and education. Reaching out to and inspiring a younger and broader audience necessitates using social media and digital platforms. Engaging narratives, accessible introductions to the rich history and repertoire of this music genre, and highlighting the uniqueness of contemporary classical musicians can serve as vital tools in rekindling interest and appreciation for classical music among the general public.

The digital age, while contributing to the decline in recording sales and keeping audiences away from live performances, also introduces new opportunities for educating and engaging viewers about classical music in innovative and captivating ways. Digital platforms, especially YouTube, have emerged as fertile ground for demystifying and disseminating classical music to a broader audience. An exemplary initiative is the "The Independent Pianist" channel<sup>15</sup>, founded by pianist Cole Anderson, which looks into the historical contexts of piano masterpieces, provides analytical insights into compositions, addresses the complexities of performance, and contrasts the styles of some of the greatest pianists in history with original scores. Anderson culminates each discussion with his performances of the pieces, offering a comprehensive exploration of classical piano music that appeals to a broad audience. Similarly, the "How I Met the Opera" channel<sup>16</sup>, created by conductor Anna Castro Grinstein, was awarded support by the German Music Council (Deutscher Musikrat).<sup>17</sup> This channel offers viewers insights from a conductor's perspective, such as explaining the role of conductors and showcasing Leonard Bernstein's performance score while explicating the uniqueness of his conducting art. Such content provides a valuable educational resource beyond what readings can offer, making the intricacies of classical music more accessible and understandable to the general public.

Beyond YouTube, an array of digital platforms, including Podcasts, MasterClass, and The Great Courses, provide free and paid lectures on classical music, offering insights that transcend the limitations of traditional book readings or the financial constraints associated with one-on-one teaching experiences. These platforms democratize access to classical music education, enabling enthusiasts to explore the

depths of this musical genre from anywhere in the world, at any time, without the need for physical attendance in a classroom or private lessons. Moreover, streaming services, such as Spotify, Apple Classical, and YouTube, have revolutionized access to classical music recordings. In contrast to the past, when building a collection of vinyl records or CDs represented a significant financial investment, today's streaming platforms offer affordable, if not free, access to vast classical music libraries. This shift has allowed newcomers and enthusiasts to quickly discover and compare a wide range of compositions, performances, and interpretations.

The digital platform has also revolutionized the accessibility and visibility of international music competitions, including prestigious events such as the International Chopin Piano Competition and the Van Ciburn International Piano Competition. These live broadcasts engage a global audience, allowing viewers to follow competitors through various stages of their performances, evoking a dynamic similar to reality shows. This format has contributed to the rapid rise of classical music stars, such as Bruce Liu and Yunchan Lim, winners of the Chopin and Van Ciburn Competitions in 2021 and 2023, respectively. Lim's remarkably powerful rendition of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 (Op. 30) in the competition finals has become the most-viewed performance on YouTube, amassing over 11 million views.[18] Other prominent soloists, including Yuja Wang, Ray Chen, Lang Lang, and Seong-Jin Cho, have garnered substantial followings and are recognized as leading figures in the classical music industry. The success of these Asian musicians highlights the growing international interest in classical music, suggesting that while the genre may face significant challenges in its traditional Western context, it continues to thrive and resonate in other parts of the world.

Other than digital platforms, some concert halls, particularly those affiliated with university music departments, such as Koerner Hall in Toronto[19] and the Grand Hall's MUSE program at The University of Hong Kong[20], frequently offer pre-concert lectures by performing artists to deepen the audience's understanding and appreciation of the music. The opportunities and implications of this enhanced access are immense, allowing not only the exposure of classical music to diverse audiences but also the enrichment of its understanding and appreciation. Individuals eager to discover this art form but deterred by the high cost of recordings and reading materials can now immerse themselves in the rich history and complex beauty of classical music without financial barriers. This democratization of access introduces new audiences to the timeless relevance and emotional depth of classical music. The digital realm, in particular, serves as a powerful tool for classical music education and promotion, engaging audiences in an informative and entertaining manner.

Classical music gains a new lease on life through these platforms, reaching audiences far beyond classrooms and concert halls and fostering a renewed interest in this timeless art form.

Music executives are increasingly adopting strategic plans to attract new patrons and audiences through innovative and nontraditional programming, moving beyond the traditional concert series that has appealed to older generations of subscribers. These strategies aim to cater to a more diverse audience, particularly those inclined toward purchasing single tickets, by offering concert events that blend classical music with contemporary interests and formats. One notable trend in this direction is the organization of film music concerts, where the soundtrack of a film is performed live by an orchestra. Another exemplar model is the sold-out concerts conducted by John Williams, featuring his iconic soundtrack compositions. These performances, sometimes in collaboration with celebrated violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, have drawn large audiences and been recorded and released by the prestigious classical music label Deutsche Grammophon.

The introduction of Candlelight Concerts in 2019 represents another innovative approach to making classical music more accessible. These concerts, created by the entertainment company Fever, which also presents the "Immersive Experience" 360-degree digital art exhibition of Van Gogh globally, feature performances with hundreds of flickering electric candles illuminating the musicians on stage in local churches or community hubs across different cities worldwide and are often performed by local music students, providing them with valuable performance experience. A distinctive aspect of Candlelight Concerts is their programmatic flexibility, which includes a mix of traditional classical repertoire and popular music, presenting concerts with themes ranging from "From Bach to the Beatles" and "The Best of Hans Zimmer" to tribute programs to Taylor Swift, Joe Hisaishi, Queen, Coldplay, and others. The casual and intimate atmosphere, illuminated by hundreds of candles, resonates well with younger audiences, who may be deterred by the formal attire and etiquette traditionally associated with classical music performances. Additionally, music programs often feature musical works of just a few minutes, successfully addressing concerns about the attention spans of newcomers to classical music and making this genre more approachable and enjoyable for attendees. Bloomberg reports that Fever raised  $227 million in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management in 2022, reportedly "the largest ever for a live-entertainment tech startup," with additional undisclosed investments by Eurazeo and Vitruvian Partners.[21] One year later, Goldman Sachs secured another$ 110 million investment, giving the company a $1.8 billion valuation.[22] According to Fever's official

website,[23] the series is now performed in more than 100 cities worldwide, with three million attendees, making it "the largest seller of live classical music in the world."[24]

These new approaches demonstrate a broader effort within the classical music community to redefine the concert experience, making it more inviting and inclusive for diverse audiences. By breaking down the barriers of formality and expansively redefining the repertoire to encompass music from both the past and present, these initiatives help maintain the relevance and appeal of classical music in the 21st-century cultural landscape. Initiatives that engage new audiences and introduce them to orchestral music through innovative programming serve as exemplary models of outreach. However, concert halls and music executives should be open to venturing beyond the revered compositions of past centuries, even though these works are often reliable attractions for ticket sales. The future of classical music cannot depend solely on ticket sales or subscription packages. Instead, it must leverage corporate sponsorships, community grants, and individual donations. For over a decade, orchestras have derived a more significant portion of their total income from donations than ticket sales (Abrams-Husso 2018). Consequently, executives must develop comprehensive donor management strategies, including personalized interactions, engagement with donors, and consistent outreach efforts to secure funding.

Contemporary compositions in the classical genre continue to be created, contributing significant new works to the orchestral and operatic repertoire. Notable examples include Jonathan Harvey's String Quartet No. 4, Unsuk Chin's Cello Concerto, George Benjamin's opera Written on Skin, John Luther Adams' orchestral piece Become Ocean, Hing-yan Chan's 'Twas the Thawing Wind – for Sheng and Orchestra, and Hans Abrahamsen's Let Me Tell You. These compositions and other outstanding performances deserve the audience's appreciation and exploration. They demonstrate that classical music is not merely a reflection of the past but also a vibrant, evolving form of artistic expression.

# 4 Conclusion

Beyond the strategies previously outlined, the sustainability of classical music significantly relies on the support of patrons, including both affluent individuals and corporate entities. The alignment between the branding of orchestras, concert halls, or series programs with donors' visions, whether they prioritize education, social advocacy, or artistic achievements, is a delicate balance that requires skillful curation. Program directors should the critical responsibility of ensuring that classical music remains vibrant and resonant within the dynamic context of modern urban life. The traditional adherence to the "high culture" associated with centuries-old classical compositions faces challenges in maintaining its relevance and appeal in the contemporary world.

According to data from Statista in 2023, the outlook for classical music is not too bleak. Audience demographics in the U.S. reveal a promising trend: Baby Boomers and Generation X together account for  $31\%$  of the classical music audience, Millennials represent a significant  $48\%$ , and Generation Z accounts for  $19\%$  (Gewiese and Rau 2023a). This data indicates a substantial interest in classical music among younger generations. A similar study conducted in Canada reflects comparable trends, with Millennials and Generation Z constituting  $37\%$  and  $21\%$  of the audience, respectively, compared with  $30\%$  for Baby Boomers and  $12\%$  for Generation X, suggesting a slightly older population than in the U.S. (Gewiese and Rau 2023b). The scenario in China presents an even more youthful audience base, with Millennials alone making up  $50\%$  of the audience and Generation Z contributing another significant  $25\%$  (Gewiese and Rau 2023c). These statistics underscore the pattern that the audience of classical music is diversifying and rejuvenating across different regions. The engagement of Millennials and Generation Z indicates a vibrant future for classical music, provided that the offerings resonate with their interests and values.

To fully benefit from this potential, classical music institutions must continue innovating their programming, outreach, and engagement strategies, ensuring the genre remains accessible, relevant, and compelling to a broad spectrum of listeners. Concert programming in Asian countries and North America reflects distinct approaches to accommodating varying generational interests in classical music, showcasing the diversity in audience engagement strategies across these regions. By tailoring concert programming to reflect the diverse interests of their audiences, classical music organizations in Asia and North America endeavor to ensure the genre's relevance and sustainability in the 21st century, cultivate a broader audience base, and enrich the classical music landscape with a fusion of traditions and innovations.

By incorporating new works into their programming, concert halls, and orchestras can affirm that classical music is a "living heritage"—a rich legacy inherited from the previous generations that we are responsible for enriching and passing on to future generations, fostering an environment where the musical genre is continuously rejuvenated. Collaboration across music genres can also bring more dynamism to the classical music tradition, fostering new perspectives and expressive capacities. In essence, the "continuous recreation" of classical music as a living heritage necessitates a holistic approach that embraces tradition and innovation in equal measure, nurturing an appreciation of age-old masterpieces and encouraging the creation of new works that reflect contemporary sensibilities, which helps reconstruct the image of classical music in ways that resonate with today's audiences, ensuring that the genre remains a vibrant component of our cultural heritage. Otherwise, quoting from Eastburn's chapter, which opens this article, "... if the status quo is maintained, it is easy to picture a doomsday scenario in which classical music appears hopelessly outdated and irrelevant" (Eastburn 2018).
