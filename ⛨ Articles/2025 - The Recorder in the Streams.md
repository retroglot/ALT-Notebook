# ABSTRACT

In the first of a series of article examining the recorder players and recorder music in streaming media, Bickley discusses the recorder presence on YouTube. The 2017 "Music Consumer Insight Report", from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, indicates that a large percentage of music consumers use YouTube for accessing music. It's not difficult to recognize that cable channel MTV capitalized on, as well as broadened the audience for, music videos. MTV became a direct cultural precedent for YouTube. The presence of the Internet has now created a global democratized information environment, resulting in equal access to high quality and low quality information--and, unsurprisingly, YouTube manifests this range of quality in its music postings. Video monetization is an option for YouTube video channels that have achieved 4,000 watch hours in the previous 12 months and that have at least 1,000 subscribers. Though some recorder music channels on YouTube have large numbers of subscribers and watch hours, most recorder channels do not meet the criteria for monetization. A positive result of this is that recorder channels exhibit an ethos of community: those of us seeking recorder videos are not forced to watch channels cluttered by advertisements.

# Introduction

Noticing the growing presence of recorder players (at a wide variety of levels of skill) and of recorder music (in a wide variety of genres) in streaming media, as the Recording Reviews Editor for AR, I have undertaken a two-part article examining this phenomenon. The exploration in this article begins with the recorder presence on www.youtube.com and will continue in the second article with discussion of other subscriptionbased and free services that stream recorder music.

The dynamic nature of the internet and of these services means that some of this information will be dated by the time you read this-a snapshot of what is available at press time. Nevertheless, my hope is that this effort will both encourage greater access and demand for recorder music on these various platforms, and increase participation by our community of recorder players in its social media aspects.

# YouTube

Over the course of September 13-22, 2019, I counted 29 postings to the ARS Facebook public group at www.facebook.com/groups/americanrecordersociety. The variety of topics resembles those in other weeks. Some posts were about editions of music, some sought or expressed gratitude for advice, and others were notices about workshops-plus 13 of the postings included video links, five of them directly uploaded to Facebook and eight videos linked from YouTube. The YouTube videos included tutorials by recorder stars (like Sarah Jeffery/Team Recorder, www.youtube.com/ SarahBlokfluit, or the Consort Counsellors, www.youtube.com/channel/UCS3jGCY50YujsFsPyczQmxA), or performances of early and newly-composed music (for example, James L. Forge's arrangement for recorders of Link's Awakening, music by Minako Hamano and Kozue Ishikawa for the Nintendo game called The Legend of Zelda, https://youtu.be/S-vZgcj4J3c). That variety gives us an indication of the ways in which the recorder is present in both social media and on YouTube.

Though YouTube no longer displays the number of results from a given search, workarounds indicate upwards of 60 million when I search on the word recorder. Interestingly, only about 6 million of those videos are about audio recording devices. It's an understatement to say that the recorder (that is, the musical instrument) has a large presence on YouTube. (Our instrument falls behind some topics. YouTube videos with the tag cat number above 967 million!)

- What is YouTube?
- Who owns it? Who can use it?

According to the collaborative "History of YouTube" on Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia (accessed on September 22, 2019), YouTube is almost 15 years old, having been founded in 2005 by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim. The first video posted there was "Meet Me at the Zoo" by Jawed Karim on April 23, 2005. The web site grew very quickly and Google acquired the company in 2006 for approximately $1.65 billion.

Along the way, significant technological advances improved the quality options for user-uploaded videos. (For those who want to know more about the technological improvements, read an article by Paul A. Soukup, "Looking at, with, and through YouTube™," in Communication Research Trends 33, 2014.)

The social aspect of YouTube is a core element of its success. That aspect is present in several ways:

* relative ease for anyone to upload videos
* presence of the comment field open to all (unless closed by the owner of that video/channel)
* the affinity engine feature (that panel on the right of the screen providing thumbnails and links to other videos YouTube algorithms think will be of interest to a viewer of the video currently selected-you can see these suggestions in the screenshots accompanying parts of this article.) Following these suggestions leads a viewer to a sort of potato chip approach: you don't stop after watching one video, and a few minutes (hours? days?) later, you regain consciousness. Crazy animal videos probably have this effect more than ones of the recorder, but many YouTube users will recognize that experience, or at least the potential for that experience.

Comments can be an arena for poor etiquette and/or thoughtful dialogue, and viewers can click a thumb icon to indicate "like" or "dislike," much as on Facebook. Via the "share" feature, a viewer can easily point others to a particular video by a link (or link to an excerpt of the video) on Facebook, Twitter, Blogger, reddit, etc., with options for embedding the link in a web page or pasting the URL (the web address) into an e-mail, text or document.

For video uploads, the initial length limit set by YouTube of 10 minutes was expanded to 15 minutes-and, for verified accounts, that 15-minute limit does not apply. (Want to know how to get your YouTube account verified? No big surprise: watch a YouTube video about this topic at https://youtu.be/lm1JpeRB9ec.)

The 2017 "Music Consumer Insight Report" (www.ifpi.org/downloads/ Music-Consumer-Insight-Report-2017.pdf), from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (www.ifpi.org), indicates that a large percentage of music consumers use YouTube for accessing music. It's not difficult to recognize that cable channel MTV (launched in 1981) capitalized on, as well as broadened the audience for, music videos (usually short films that add a visual component to a piece of music). MTV became a direct cultural precedent for YouTube. The presence of the internet has now created a global democratized information environment, resulting in equal access to high quality and low quality information-and, unsurprisingly, YouTube manifests this range of quality in its music postings.

Video monetization (or more simply: getting paid for your postings) is an option for YouTube video channels that have achieved 4,000 watch hours in the previous 12 months and that have at least 1,000 subscribers. (For an introduction to making money via YouTube, watch this video at https://youtu.be/blngfKyJyUw.) Though some recorder music channels on YouTube have large numbers of subscribers and watch hours (for instance, Sarah Jeffery/Team Recorder has 49,300 subscribers; The Royal Wind Music has 51,900 subscribers), most recorder channels do not meet the criteria for monetization. A positive result of this is that recorder channels exhibit an ethos of community: those of us seeking recorder videos are not forced to watch channels cluttered by advertisements.

How to search for recorder music on YouTube

Just as when searching on YouTube's corporate parent Google, the secret is wise use of keywords. Visiting www.youtube.com and entering the word recorder in the search box yields an overwhelming number of results! There is some entertainment value in watching one video after another, but likely you will prefer to seek a specific video: performances of a certain piece, by a particular performer, tutorials, etc.

When looking for performances of a particular work, often the composer's family name and a couple of words from the title will get useful results. For example, Handel recorder C major returns approximately 7,000 performances of all or part of Handel's Sonata, Opus 1, No. 11, HWV365. Some of the performances are played on modern flute and piano, but the repertoire is there, and the videos demonstrate a variety of approaches to interpretation, ornamentation, etc. One particularly well-done channel is The Modern Recorder (www.youtube.com/TheModernRecorder), which presents the notation for the viewer as well as superb performances of significant works for recorder from the 20th and 21st centuries. There are videos of other repertory for recorder that use the "read along" approach, and there is room for many more covering all periods of music.

Apply a similar strategy to find recordings of a performer or ensemble. You might search for Frans Brüggen recorder or Anne Timberlake recorder or The Royal Wind Music or Quinta Essentia Recorder Quartet.

A frustrating aspect is the frequent lack of details regarding personnel performing in a given video. This is not so much an issue with a soloist, but becomes one in ensemble recordings. To find more information, I resort to searching in another search engine tab for the ensemble's own web site (for example, the current members of The Royal Wind Music are listed at http://royalwindmusic.org/ overrwm.php?p=8, but not on their YouTube channel, nor have I found personnel lists for their earlier video performances).

It is worth noting that maintaining a YouTube channel is every bit as labor-intensive as any other social media endeavor, or as it is to keep fresh content on a web site. Even top-notch professional musicians likely find it challenging to provide as much detail as would be ideal.

You can subscribe to YouTube channels without cost and receive notifications when new videos are posted. To subscribe, you must have a free YouTube account (you can sign in with a Gmail address, and you don't have to post videos of your own). For instance, you could subscribe to the ARS's channel, www.youtube.com/ americanrecordermag, and receive notifications of new content posted there.

As a response to the changing ways in which we access music, the Recording Reviews department in AR now includes relevant links to streaming media. Some recording labels put releases, excerpts, interviews, etc., online via YouTube to gain wider audiences, and to interest music consumers in purchasing the disc or downloads from it. As examples, Our Recordings (www.ourrecordings.com), a label launched by Danish recorder virtuosa Michala Petri and guitarist/ lutenist Lars Hannibal in 2006, maintains a large collection of videos on their YouTube channel, www.youtube.com/OURrecordings/videos. Videos of Eric Bosgraaf may be found at the Brilliant Classics YouTube channel, www.youtube. com/BrülantClassics. To locate those channels, visit the direct link from each company's web site to that CD on their YouTube channel, or visit YouTube and use the search feature by clicking on the magnifying glass (and then entering, for instance, Bosgraaf).

# YouTube as a source of tutorials

While face-to-face private lessons and classes rightly hold the primary place in learning to play recorder, there are numerous tutorial videos on YouTube. One series that my own students, as well as many others, have found helpful and engaging is Sarah Jeffery's Team Recorder channel, www.youtube.com/ SarahBlokfluit. Over 200 videos there cover a wide range of topics, such as "Do you actually need a music teacher?", "Warmups for Musicians: Breathing and Sound," playalongs, and performances. Asked about her decision to create her Team Recorder YouTube channel, Jeffery responded that she loves the community aspect, the element of serendipity in discovering videos of interest, the large reach of YouTube-and she wishes she'd had such a resource as a teenager. "When I began posting on Youtube there was barely anything about the recorder, and in the meantime a real community has grown, with quite a few other channels. I LOVE THIS!" she writes. Her enthusiasm and choice of relevant topics garners a large following. A focus on ensemble practice drives the Consort Counsellors, Hester Groenleer and María Martínez Ayerza, on their channel, www.youtube.com/ UCS3jGCY50YujfsPyczQmxA. These musicians are also members of Seldom Sene Recorder Quintet and The Royal Wind Music (CDs by both groups have been reviewed in the pages ofAR-a review of a recording by The Royal Wind Music appears in this issue). They bring their rich ensemble experience to bear in videos covering ensemble warmup, tuning, phrasing, etc. Ayerza notes satisfying aspects of their use of YouTube: "We enjoy that many different formats are possible and all work really well-a lengthy video of 15 minutes, a short trailer or a live session. It is also very useful that followers can contribute subtitles in various languages- many Consort Counsellors videos now have Spanish, German and soon French translations, and this is very easy to edit and manage."

Many other recorder tutorials can be located by searching keywords, such as recorder lesson articulation. Also please note that you get different results with recorder lesson tonguing, so remember to repeat a search using synonyms/related terms.

While not geared only to teaching, the ARS YouTube channel at www.youtube.com/americanrecordermag/videos includes postings of lessons to help beginners, produced by the ARS with MonkeySee and featuring recorder teacher Vicki Boeckman. There you will also find another half-dozen or so videos that touch on intermediate-level technique, most posted as adjuncts to the four-part series of American Recorder Practice Project articles. Some videos on the ARS channel include ways to "read along" with the music associated with the video.

Finding information about recorders, their makers, and other music topics YouTube yields videos demonstrating particular types and makers of recorders. For instance, the Mollenhauer-Blockfloeten channel, www.youtube.com/ BlockfloetenPodcast/videos, includes demonstrations of various models, plus performances, lectures or workshops, and information about the process of making and taking care of recorders. Searching on the string Tom Prescott recorder returns videos of performances using Prescott instruments. You'll also find a 20-minute interview with Prescott from 2009 (as in the screenshot on the next page), conducted by recorder professional Daniel Brüggen. Similarly, searching for a type of recorder (Eagle recorder or Paetzold recorder) brings many examples of performances using those instruments.

Amidst the popular phenomenon of "unboxing" videos (just what they sound like: people open boxes and narrate their actions), not many exist for recorder players. I found the one above, in which Sarah Jeffery shows the process of unpacking her new Paetzold. Perhaps you'd like to make your own unboxing video when you get a new recorder! Often there is more obvious partisanship and varying quality in videos on musical topics (like musica ficta), yet they can be helpful. Whether seeking information on instruments or on music terminology/concepts, it's always good to use a variety of sources: reviews, encyclopedias, music textbooks, etc., as well as YouTube.

Interested in posting your own videos?

When you browse recorder videos on YouTube, you'll see a great variety of approaches. Some demonstrate high production values and creativity. At one end of the spectrum, we can find Ernesto Schmied's excellent video of Cornelius Cardew's Treatise at https://youtu.be/TWheDNrei1U. There's also Seldom Sene's video of Thomas Tallis's O sacrum convivium, https://youtu.be/1r5rdOGrBBA; or even Recorder Arcade's version of the popular tune Peaceful Days, composed by Yasunori Mitsuda for the video game Chrono Trigger, https://youtu.be/Sv3wEAFqSQY.

On the other end of the spectrum are many examples of a video recorded on a cell phone, with music played by performers whose technique ranges from beginner to accomplished. Those early stage players deserve praise for enthusiasm and putting themselves before a global audience. It's a heartening sign of vitality of the recorder world that most comments on even humble performances are encouraging.

There is advice online about how to shoot your own video-in fact, too much to cover here. Flip to page 45 in this magazine issue for some ideas I found ("The Recorder in the Streams" Extra: Interested in making and uploading your own video to YouTube?). Always bear in mind that higher quality playing and audio/video production have a higher impact on your audience.

A few more suggestions

You will be your best guide to exploring recorder videos on YouTube. An excellent starting place is the collection of videos and links found on the ARS's channel, www.youtube.com/ americanrecordermag; at press time, the most recent videos were beginning recorder lessons and those related to the American Recorder Practice Project. Other videos posted there showcase various performances and a few interviews with or by recorder luminaries. That collection of videos is a growing archive of material of direct relevance to all of us in the ARS. In fact, the ARS channel was created in 2011 for the purpose of adding multimedia supplementary files to this magazine's print articles and event reports, as well as to serve as a landing page for people to look for other recorder pages on YouTube. (Feel free to suggest pages to "like" or to be added to the subscriptions list there!)

Additionally, historic treasures on YouTube merit hours of your time- like Quadro Hotteterre performing Giovanni Battista Sammartini, https:// youtu.be/QZveOxRXB7l. You'll find performances by virtuoso performers early in their careers: Lucie Horsch performing Leonard Bernstein, https:// youtu.be/EOWOIKTUDN4. You'll encounter strong performances by devoted community-based musicians (like the Barbary Coast Recorder Orchestra mentioned in my overview on making your own videos-or others linked from the ARS YouTube channel) as well as efforts showing varying levels of technique and musicality. Useful tutorials from the previously mentioned Team Recorder and Consort Counsellors provide guidance that is readily available, day or night.

It is impossible to compile a listing of even just the YouTube recorder videos that exhibit exemplary playing and teaching, much less those of somewhat lesser merit. Therefore I apologize to colleagues and friends, known and unknown, for omitting links to your work-and I encourage you all to explore, create and share your own playlists of material you deem worthy.

E-mail your suggestions to editor@americanrecorder.org, or post them on the ARS Facebook group.
