A year of chaos. That is how many researchers in the United States, at least, will remember 2025. Cuts to federal funding and the federal workforce, political threats to US universities, an immigration crackdown and the country's withdrawal from global organizations have stymied research in many fields and reshaped, probably for decades to come, the landscape of the world's leading sponsor of science (see page 530). Throughout the world, financial pressures, political interference and rising nationalist sentiment have put increased strain on a scientific enterprise that thrives on independence, openness and diversity, as Nature's special series on the future of universities has reported over the past few months (see go.nature.com/4qf8Nyu).

> 混乱的一年。这至少会是美国许多研究者对 2025 年的记忆。联邦资金和联邦工作人员的削减，对美国大学的政治威胁，移民政策的收紧以及该国退出全球组织的行为，已阻碍了许多领域的研究，并可能在未来的几十年里重塑这个全球领先科学资助国的格局（见第 530 页）。 正如《自然》杂志过去几个月关于大学未来的特别系列报道所述（参见 go.nature.com/4qf8Nyu ），在全球范围内，财政压力、政治干预以及日益高涨的民族主义情绪，正对依赖独立性、开放性和多样性而蓬勃发展的科学事业施加越来越大的压力。

Yet there remains much to celebrate – which is made plain in the stories of the scientists and innovators profiled in this year's Nature's 10, a selection of ten people who shaped the research landscape in 2025 (see page 515).

> 然而仍有许多值得庆贺之处——这一点在今年的《自然》年度十大人物故事中得到了充分体现，这十位入选者塑造了 2025 年的研究格局（详见第 515 页）。

Some stood up for scientific values, such as Susan Monarez, who was fired after a brief tenure as head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during which time she was asked to pre-approve vaccine recommendations without considering the relevant data.

> 其中一些人捍卫了科学价值观，例如 Susan Monarez，她在短暂担任美国疾病控制与预防中心主任期间，因拒绝在不考虑相关数据的情况下预先批准疫苗建议而被解雇。

Others kept the flame of multilateralism and evidence-based policymaking burning. In a year of rising tensions and unresolved conflicts, the agreement of the world's first pandemic treaty in April was a bright spot. Some details still need to be hammered out, but representatives of the 190-odd nations that are members of the World Health Organization – with the exception of the United States, which withdrew from the treaty negotiations in January – managed to forge an agreement on how humanity should prevent and prepare for future pandemics. Negotiations leader Precious Matsoso, a former director-general of South Africa's health department, describes the gruelling process, and how persistence, humour and a constructive approach paid off.

> 其他人则继续维系着多边主义和循证决策的火种。在紧张局势加剧与冲突悬而未决的一年中，四月达成**全球首个大流行病条约**成为一抹亮色。尽管部分细节仍需敲定，但世界卫生组织约190个成员国的代表——除美国外（该国已于1月退出条约谈判）——成功就人类应如何预防和防范未来大流行病达成共识。谈判负责人、南非卫生部前总司长 Precious Matsoso 讲述了这一艰辛历程，以及坚持、幽默和建设性态度如何最终取得成果。

And several feed humanity's insatiable thirst for knowledge. In 2025, geoscientist and diver Mengran Du at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering in Sanya and her colleagues reported the deepest ecosystem known to host animals, in an underwater trench northeast of Japan[^1]. This chemosynthetic ecosystem derives its energy from methane and other compounds that seep up from the ocean floor – in contrast to most life, which depends on sunlight and the process of photosynthesis. There is still much about our planet that we don't understand, but a thriving global enterprise of science can uncover its mysteries.

> 其中一些满足着人类对知识永不满足的渴望。在 2025 年，位于三亚的中国科学院深海科学与工程研究所的地球科学家兼潜水员 Mengran Du 及其同事，在日本东北部的一处海沟中报告了已知栖息动物的最深生态系统[^1]。这一化学合成生态系统从海底渗出的甲烷及其他化合物中获取能量——这与依赖阳光和光合作用过程的大多数生命形式形成对比。关于我们的星球，仍有许多我们尚未理解之处，但一个蓬勃发展的全球科学事业能够揭示其奥秘。

Reflecting that, seven of this year's profiles are of individuals outside the United States. Among them is entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, China, whose company created the country's home-grown artificial-intelligence model DeepSeek-R1. The breakneck speed of developments in AI – with all its benefits and risks – was another key story of this year. DeepSeek stunned the world with a model that had capabilities on a par with the best tools designed by more established technology firms, yet made for a fraction of the cost and with unusual openness. In September, the model became the first major AI tool to be scrutinized by peer review, with the results published in this journal[^2].

> 有鉴于此，今年的年度人物特写中有七位来自美国以外地区。其中包括中国杭州的企业家 Liang Wenfeng，其公司研发了国产人工智能模型 DeepSeek-R1。人工智能领域以惊人的速度发展——伴随其全方位的机遇与风险——成为今年的另一关键议题。DeepSeek 凭借其模型能力震惊世界，该模型性能足以与成熟科技公司打造的最优工具比肩，而开发成本却大幅降低，并展现出非同寻常的开放性。在 9 月，该模型成为首个接受同行评审的主要人工智能工具，评审结果已发表于本刊[^2]。

Transformative science can transform lives. Entomologist Luciano Moreira established a company in Curitiba, Brazil, that infects Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with a bacterium called Wolbachia, curbing the insects' ability to transmit human pathogens. Moreira helped to persuade the government to use the approach to combat the mosquito-borne disease dengue, which killed some 6,300 people in Brazilian cities last year.

> 变革性的科学能够改变生活。昆虫学家 Luciano Moreira 在巴西 Curitiba 创立了一家公司，通过让埃及伊蚊感染一种名为 Wolbachia 的细菌，来抑制这种昆虫传播人类病原体的能力。Moreira 帮助说服政府采用这种方法来对抗去年在巴西城市导致了约 6,300 人死亡的蚊媒疾病登革热。

And, in Israel, systems biologist Yifat Merbl at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot and her team reported that a piece of cellular machinery – the proteasome, which chops up proteins into smaller peptide fragments – has a role in immunity[^3]. They found that many of these peptides have antimicrobial properties and that cells use them as a first line of defence against bacteria.

> 在以色列，位于 Rehovot 的 Weizmann Institute of Science 的系统生物学家 Yifat Merbl 及其团队报告称，细胞机制的一部分——即负责将蛋白质切割成较小肽段的蛋白酶体——在免疫中发挥着作用[^3]。他们发现，这些肽段中的许多具有抗菌特性，并且细胞利用它们作为抵御细菌的第一道防线。

Besides being at the cutting edge of their fields, Moreira and Merbl share something else: they both studied in the United States before returning home. Their stories are a reminder of the unique part the country has played in recent decades in supporting science around the world, as it has nurtured its own research – a win–win for the nation and the world. That network now seems at risk as an immigration crackdown makes it more difficult, more expensive and less attractive for researchers globally to study and work not just in the United States, but in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, too.

> 除了身处各自领域的前沿，Moreira 和 Merbl 还有另一个共同点：他们都曾在美国学习，随后返回自己的祖国。他们的经历提醒我们，近几十年来美国在支持全球科学发展的同时，也培育了自身的研究体系——这对美国乃至世界而言是一种双赢。然而，随着移民政策收紧，全球研究人员不仅在美国，也在英国、澳大利亚和加拿大等国家学习与工作变得更为困难、成本更高且吸引力下降，这一科研网络如今似乎正面临风险。

The individuals who feature in Nature's 10, and their breakthroughs, showcase the ongoing strength of science globally: its ability to transcend national borders and nurture collaboration, and its power to save and improve lives, satisfy curiosity and spark innovation. They also serve as a reminder of what is lost when governments cease to follow the evidence, stop funding excellent science and fail to nurture the international collaborative spirit that creates the breakthroughs that make the world a better place for all.

> 入选《自然》杂志年度十大人物及其突破性成就，彰显了全球科学持续发展的力量：它能够跨越国界、促进协作，具备拯救与改善生命、满足人类好奇心并激发创新的能量。同时，这些人物与成就也提醒我们：当政府不再遵循科学证据、停止资助卓越科研、未能培育推动突破的国际协作精神时，人类将失去让世界变得更美好的重要动力。
