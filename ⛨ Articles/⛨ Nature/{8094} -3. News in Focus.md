Last week, Australia became the first country to ban children under the age of 16 from using most social-media platforms. Many teenagers in the country are furious, but for social scientists, the policy offers a natural experiment to study the effects of social-media restrictions on young people.

> 上周，Australia 成为首个禁止 16 岁以下儿童使用大多数社交媒体平台的国家。该国许多青少年对此感到愤怒，但对社会科学家而言，这项政策为研究社交媒体限制对年轻人的影响提供了一次自然实验。

Technology companies have had a year to come up with ways to stop teenagers in the country using their platforms, including Facebook, X, Reddit, YouTube, Threads and Snapchat. From 10 December, companies must take reasonable steps to prevent young people from creating or keeping accounts, or risk fines of up to Aus$49.5 million (US$33 million).

> 科技公司已有一年时间制定措施，以阻止该国青少年使用其旗下平台，包括 Facebook、X、Reddit、YouTube、Threads 和 Snapchat。自 12 月 10 日起，相关企业必须采取合理措施，防止青少年创建或保留账户，否则将面临最高 4950 万澳元（合 3300 万美元）的罚款。

Other countries, including France, Denmark and Spain, have introduced social-media restrictions for young people, or announced plans to, but no policy is as far-reaching as Australia's. Its government says that social media is harming young people's mental health, causing teenagers to lose sleep because of addictive design features and exposing them to harmful content. But some researchers say the evidence that social media causes harm is mixed. Communicating with peers online is a crucial support system for some young people, particularly those in minority groups and those living in remote areas.

> 其他国家，包括法国、丹麦和西班牙，已针对年轻人推出社交媒体限制措施，或宣布了相关计划，但尚无任何政策的覆盖面如澳大利亚这般广泛。该国政府表示，社交媒体正在损害年轻人的心理健康，因其成瘾性设计功能导致青少年失眠，并使他们接触有害内容。但一些研究人员指出，社交媒体造成伤害的证据其实好坏参半。对部分年轻人而言，在线与同龄人交流是重要的支持系统，尤其是少数群体和偏远地区的青少年。 

Nature spoke to researchers who will study the effects of the ban.

## New avenues of research
**新的研究途径**

For Susan Sawyer, a physician-researcher specializing in adolescent health at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia, the start of the social-media ban last week meant entering the next phase of her research. Over the past two months, Sawyer and her colleagues interviewed 177 teenagers aged 13-16 about their social-media use, screen time and mental health before the ban came into effect. She and her colleagues plan to survey the teenagers again in six months, to see whether the ban has affected their use of the platforms or their mental health. The researchers will also survey the participants' parents about problematic Internet and social-media use by their children.

> 对于 Susan Sawyer 这位来自澳大利亚墨尔本 Murdoch Children's Research Institute 专注于青少年健康的医师兼研究员而言，上周开始的社交媒体禁令意味着她的研究进入了新阶段。在过去两个月里，Sawyer 和她的同事在禁令生效前采访了 177 名 13 至 16 岁的青少年，了解他们的社交媒体使用情况、屏幕使用时间以及心理健康状况。她和同事计划在六个月后再次对这些青少年进行调查，以观察禁令是否影响了他们对社交平台的使用或心理健康状况。研究人员还将对参与者的父母进行问卷调查，了解其子女是否存在网络及社交媒体使用问题。

Another collaboration between the Kids Research Institute Australia, the University of Western Australia and Edith Cowan University, all in Perth, will examine whether the ban is presenting new parenting challenges and what family conflicts have arisen as a result.

> 澳大利亚儿童研究所、西澳大利亚大学与伊迪斯科文大学再度携手合作，这三所机构均位于 Perth，将共同研究此项禁令是否带来了新的育儿挑战，以及由此引发了哪些家庭冲突。

Amanda Third, a researcher at Western Sydney University in Australia who studies how children use technology, says the ban is an opportunity to collect data about the effect of policies that restrict young people's access to the Internet and social media. She is going to investigate how teenagers engage with technology and the Internet, and how their face-to-face interactions might change following the ban.

> Amanda Third，一位来自澳大利亚 Western Sydney University 的研究人员，专注于研究儿童如何运用科技，她认为此次禁令为收集数据提供了契机，旨在探究限制青少年接触互联网与社交媒体的政策会产生何种影响。她计划深入调查青少年如何接触科技与互联网，以及在禁令实施后，他们面对面的互动方式可能发生哪些变化。

But, she says, it might be hard to tell whether any changes are a direct result of the ban or other policies designed to make the Internet safer: for example, later this month, new industry standards will come into effect for tech companies to prevent children being exposed to sexually explicit or violent content on the Internet. The social-media ban could undercut some well-thought-out efforts to keep children on social media and positively impact their experiences online, she says. "The ban is about booting them out."

> 然而她表示，很难判断这些变化是禁令的直接结果，还是其他旨在提升网络安全的政策所致：例如本月晚些时候，针对科技公司的新行业标准即将生效，以防止儿童接触网络色情与暴力内容。她指出，社交媒体禁令可能会削弱某些精心设计的努力，这些努力旨在引导儿童合理使用社交媒体，并对他们的网络体验产生积极影响。“这项禁令的本质是将他们踢出网络空间。”

Zareh Ghazarian, a political scientist at Monash University in Melbourne who studies the role of social media in young people's political development, says online platforms can be an important way for teenagers to engage with politics. Teachers can discuss contemporary issues, political debates and policy issues that come up on social media, he says. Now that the ban is in place, he plans to interview teachers to find out how it is affecting students' political knowledge, and what alternative platforms they are turning to. "Part of education is to be able to engage with issues and ideas that may not be covered in the classroom – and that was the benefit social media was bringing," he says.

> 墨尔本 Monash 大学的政治学家 Zareh Ghazarian 主要研究社交媒体在年轻人政治发展中的作用，他指出网络平台是青少年参与政治的重要途径。他表示，教师可以借助社交媒体上出现的时事议题、政治辩论和政策问题进行课堂讨论。随着禁令的实施，他计划访谈教师以了解此举如何影响学生的政治认知，以及学生正在转向哪些替代平台。他谈到：“教育的部分意义在于能够接触课堂未涵盖的议题与观点——而这正是社交媒体曾带来的益处。”

## Unintended consequences
**非预期的后果**

Daniel Angus studies the impact of technology on society at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, including the experiences young people have on social media. Now, he will focus on how they stay connected to their community, and whether they are trying to circumvent the ban. "We are tracking things like app downloads and search queries," says Angus, to monitor whether teens are migrating to platforms that are not targeted by the new legislation. "We know, for example, Lemon8 (a video and photo-sharing app) and Yope (an app for sharing photos in private groups) are big in the app downloads," he adds. Tracking which platforms teenagers are moving to, and what those platforms are like, can help researchers to create resources for young people and their parents, so they can have a positive experience using the platform.

> Daniel Angus 在澳大利亚布里斯班的 [[Queensland University of Technology|昆士兰科技大学]] 研究技术对社会的影响，包括年轻人在社交媒体上的经历。现在，他将专注于他们如何保持与社区的联系，以及他们是否试图规避禁令。“我们正在追踪诸如 app 下载和搜索查询之类的事情，” Angus 说，以监测青少年是否正在迁移到新立法未针对的平台。“我们知道，例如， Lemon8（一个视频和照片分享应用）和 Yope（一个在私人群组中分享照片的应用）在应用下载中很受欢迎，”他补充道。追踪青少年正在迁移到哪些平台，以及这些平台是什么样的，可以帮助研究人员为年轻人及其父母开发资源，以便他们在使用平台时拥有积极的体验。

But the ban has made some other aspects of his research harder, he says. As part of a five-year project, Angus used dummy Facebook accounts to track how alcohol is advertised online. Those accounts were removed recently, and he cannot make new ones because of the verifications Facebook has introduced to prevent teenagers from making accounts, such as requiring new users to supply their driver's licence or another form of government identification. "Our ability to have and manage these 'sock puppet' accounts, which were really important from a public-health, public-information and oversight perspective, has been completely curtailed," he adds.

> 但 Angus 表示，这项禁令也使他研究的其他方面变得更加困难。作为一项为期五年的研究项目，他曾使用虚拟 Facebook 账户追踪酒精饮料的在线广告投放情况。这些账户近期已被移除，而由于 Facebook 为防止未成年人注册账户引入了验证机制——例如要求新用户提供驾驶执照或其他政府身份证明文件——他无法再创建新的虚拟账户。他补充道：“我们拥有并管理这些‘傀儡账户’的能力已完全受限，而从公共卫生、公共信息及监管的角度来看，这些账户至关重要。”

## Safety monitoring
**安全监控**

Australia's independent eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, will monitor how the ban affects children. Both Third and Sawyer are on a panel of specialists, led by Stanford University in California, guiding a two-year evaluation of the ban for the eSafety commissioner.

> 澳大利亚的独立电子安全专员 Julie Inman Grant 将监督此项禁令对儿童的影响。Third 和 Sawyer 均是专家小组的成员，该小组由加利福尼亚州的 Stanford University 领导，负责为电子安全专员开展为期两年的禁令效果评估。

Third says the committee will observe whether children spend more time outdoors, feel connected to their peers, feel safer online or are better equipped to handle mis- and disinformation.

> Third 表示，委员会将观察儿童是否在户外活动时间增加、与同龄人的联系更为紧密、在网络环境中感到更安全，以及是否更能妥善应对错误信息和虚假信息。

In a major boost to research on [[Long COVID]] and [[Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)]], also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), the German government has announced that it will provide €500 million (US$582 million) in research funding to support a National Decade Against Post-Infectious Diseases from 2026 to 2036.

> 在针对 [[Long COVID|长期新冠肺炎]] 与 [[Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)|慢性疲劳综合征]] 的研究迎来重大推动之际，德国政府宣布将提供 5 亿欧元（约合 5.82 亿美元）的研究资金，用以支持自 2026 年至 2036 年实施的“国家抗击感染后疾病十年计划”。

Germany is one of many countries facing an unprecedented health burden owing to long COVID and other post-infection syndromes since the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost one in five people in a German cohort had long COVID in 2022[^2-1], and around one in seven people in the United States were affected by long COVID by late 2023[^2-2]. This translates to a considerable burden on health care and the economy – the syndrome is estimated to cost the world economy US$1 trillion every year[^2-3]. "From many conversations, I know what a great burden these illnesses represent for those affected and their families," said Dorothee Bär, the German federal minister for research, in a press release announcing the funding. "There are still no simple solutions or therapies for ME/CFS and post-viral autoimmune diseases, and previous scientific studies demonstrate the complexity of the disease mechanisms."

> 自 COVID-19 大流行以来，德国与许多国家一样，因长期新冠及其他感染后综合征而承受着前所未有的健康负担。2022 年，德国某队列中近五分之一的人患有长期新冠[^2-1]，而到 2023 年底，美国约七分之一的人口受到长期新冠影响[^2-2]。这意味着医疗系统与经济将承受巨大压力——据估计，该综合征每年给全球经济造成 1 万亿美元的损失[^2-3]。德国联邦研究部长 Dorothee Bär 在宣布资助的新闻稿中表示：“通过多次交流，我深知这些疾病对患者及其家庭造成的沉重负担。目前针对肌痛性脑脊髓炎/慢性疲劳综合征（ME/CFS）与病毒后自身免疫性疾病仍缺乏简便的解决方案或疗法，先前科学研究也揭示了其疾病机制的复杂性。”

"This is really major funding," says Rafael Mikolajczyk, an epidemiologist at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, agrees, saying it's "a great step in the right direction". Long COVID has become politicized and "less of a priority for governments around the world", he adds.

> “这确实是一笔重大资金，” 德国马丁·路德大学哈勒-维滕贝格分校的流行病学家 Rafael Mikolajczyk 表示。圣路易斯华盛顿大学的临床流行病学家 Ziyad Al-Aly 对此表示赞同，称这是“朝着正确方向迈出的重要一步”。他补充道，长期新冠已被政治化，且“对世界各国政府而言已不再是优先事项”。

## What research is the money expected to support?
**这笔资金预计支持哪些研究？**

The German government aims to fund research into a wide variety of post-infectious diseases, including long COVID and ME/CFS. It also aims to cover a range of topics, including the pathophysiology and immunology of the conditions, diagnostics and biomarkers, mental health and neurology, and long-term consequences on health.

> 德国政府计划资助多种传染病后遗症的研究，包括 [[Long COVID|长期新冠]] 与 ME/CFS。研究范围将涵盖病理生理学、免疫学机制、诊断与生物标志物、心理健康与神经学影响，以及长期健康后果等多个方向。

The language is deliberately broad, says Al-Aly, who under the Biden administration co-chaired the committee that created the US National Research Action Plan for Long COVID. "You don't want to shackle your scientists with a very narrow scope," he says. He applauds the funding for including all post-infectious conditions, which share many commonalities, and for embracing a variety of disciplines.

> 这一措辞是刻意宽泛的，在拜登政府时期共同主持制定美国 Long COVID 国家研究行动计划的 Al-Aly 表示。"你不希望用非常狭隘的范围束缚你的科学家，"他说。他赞扬了该资助计划涵盖所有具有诸多共性的感染后病症，并纳入了多学科视角。

Because the German funding is not yet allocated, the next step is for scientists and patients to be brought in, to shape exactly how the money will be spent, says Ulrike Protzer, a virologist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany.

> 由于德国的资金尚未分配，德国慕尼黑工业大学的病毒学家 Ulrike Protzer 表示，下一步是引入科学家和患者，共同确定资金的具体使用方式。

One fundamental challenge for managing conditions such as long COVID is to identify the mechanisms operating in each individual affected, says [[Akiko Iwasaki]], an immunologist at Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut. Only then can they be recruited into clinical trials of medications that will treat these root causes. That means linking biomarker studies to clinical trials, says Al-Aly – for example, giving antivirals mainly to people with persistent viral infections.

> 管理诸如[[Long COVID|长期新冠肺炎]]等病症的一个根本性挑战，在于识别每位受影响个体体内的作用机制，康涅狄格州耶鲁医学院的免疫学家[[Akiko Iwasaki|岩崎明子]]指出。唯有如此，这些个体才能被纳入针对根本病因的药物临床试验中。这意味着需要将生物标志物研究与临床试验相结合，Al-Aly 表示——例如，主要向存在持续病毒感染的人群提供抗病毒药物。

Nisreen Alwan, a public-health specialist at the University of Southampton, UK, also wants to see more research characterizing the public-health burden of post-infection conditions. "How do we quantify the burden of acute infections in terms of chronic disease? What are the pathways to prevention? How can we address the risk factors?" She compares viral infections to outdoor air pollution, the impacts of which on cardiovascular health have now been quantified - spurring efforts to cut pollution levels. "That's where we should be heading for acute viral infections," she says.

> 英国南安普顿大学的公共卫生专家 Nisreen Alwan 同样希望看到更多关于感染后病症公共卫生负担特征的研究。“我们应如何从慢性疾病的角度量化急性感染的负担？有哪些预防途径？我们该如何应对风险因素？”她将病毒感染比作室外空气污染——后者对心血管健康的影响现已得到量化，并推动了降低污染水平的努力。“这正是我们在应对急性病毒感染时应努力的方向。”她说道。

Germany isn't alone in its push for research on post-infection syndromes. However, "a lot of other countries are lagging behind", says [[Akiko Iwasaki|Iwasaki]], "especially in places like Asia, where there's very little funding, if any, dedicated to this post-acute phase of infectious disease".

> 德国并非唯一推动感染后综合征研究的国家。然而，[[Akiko Iwasaki|岩崎明子]]指出，“许多其他国家仍处于落后状态，尤其是在亚洲等地，这些地区几乎没有任何专门针对传染病急性期后阶段的资助”。

## What happened with previous research drives?
**先前的研究驱动计划遭遇了什么？**

In the United States, the National Institutes of Health established RECOVER in 2021, which carried $1.8 billion of funding for long-COVID research. However, many long-COVID projects, including some funded by RECOVER, were abruptly cancelled in March by the Trump administration[^2-4], although some were restored after protests and lawsuits.

> 在美国，国立卫生研究院于 2021 年设立了 RECOVER 项目，该项目为[[Long COVID|长期新冠]]研究提供了 18 亿美元的资金支持。然而，包括部分由 RECOVER 资助在内的许多长期新冠研究项目，在三月被特朗普政府突然叫停，尽管其中一些项目在抗议和诉讼后得以恢复。

Iwasaki saw her project on long-COVID pathogenesis marked for cancellation and then reprieved. "The patients got together and really worked with the administration to restore funding," she says. Despite these challenges, research has progressed significantly in the past few years, says Iwasaki. "Not only do we understand better the symptoms and the clusters of symptoms, but we now have a lot more data on the biological mechanisms." Multiple mechanisms can contribute to long COVID, including immunological dysfunctions such as autoantibodies that attack the body's own tissues, persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the body and reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr virus, she says.

> [[Akiko Iwasaki|岩崎明子]]目睹其关于[[Long COVID|长期新冠]]病理机制的研究项目先被标记为取消，随后又获得恢复。“患者们团结起来，积极与管理部门沟通以恢复资金支持，”她表示。尽管面临这些挑战，岩崎明子指出过去几年该领域研究已取得显著进展。“我们不仅对症状及其集群现象有了更深入的理解，现在更掌握了大量关于生物机制的数据。”她解释道，多种机制可能共同导致[[Long COVID|长期新冠]]，包括免疫系统功能异常（例如攻击自身组织的自身抗体）、SARS-CoV-2 病毒在体内的持续存在，以及潜伏 Epstein-Barr 病毒的重新激活。

Some of this research could result in potential treatments. For example, [[Akiko Iwasaki|Iwasaki]] hopes to set up a clinical trial to test whether treatments to reduce autoantibody levels could help people whose long COVID is driven by autoantibodies. Other trials should test antivirals in people with persistent viral infections, but she adds that these trials are "aspirational" because of funding cuts.

> 部分研究可能催生潜在的治疗方法。例如，[[Akiko Iwasaki|岩崎明子]]希望开展临床试验，验证降低自身抗体水平的疗法是否对由自身抗体驱动的[[Long COVID|长期新冠]]患者有效。其他试验则应在持续病毒感染患者中测试抗病毒药物，但她补充称，由于资金削减，这些试验目前仍属“理想化”范畴。

# CHINA'S PLAN TO LEAD THE WORLD ON AI REGULATION
China is driving efforts to create an international system to govern use of artificial intelligence.
# By Elizabeth Gibney
Despite risks ranging from exacerbating inequality to causing existential catastrophe, the world has yet to agree on regulations to govern artificial intelligence. Although a patchwork of national and regional regulations exists, for many countries binding rules are still being fleshed out.
In October, at a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his country's proposal to create a body known as the World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization (WAICO), which would bring
nations together as a step towards creating a global governance system for AI.
The proposal is part of a wider drive to be at the helm of efforts to govern AI, in contrast to a US approach that is focused on deregulation. When it comes to transparency and AI policy, "China is the good guy at the moment," Wendy Hall, a computer scientist at the University of Southampton, UK, told reporters at an event in London in October.
Many hurdles lie in the way to creating a binding intergovernmental agreement on AI, but some advocates say it is possible, comparing the technology to other risky but useful endeavours for which agreements exist, such as nuclear power and aviation.

China's President Xi Jinping speaking at the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting.

Nature looks at China's approach, what a global AI governance body might look like and its chance of success.
# How does China's AI ecosystem differ from those of other nations?
Encouraged by the government, Chinese firms tend to release models as open weight, meaning that they can be downloaded and built on. And compared with Western nations, China has less of a focus on making machines that could outsmart humans – often referred to as artificial general intelligence – and is instead concentrating on a race to use AI to drive economic growth. This is exemplified by a policy introduced in August called AI+, says Kwan Yee Ng, who leads international AI governance at Concordia AI, a Beijing-based consultancy that focuses on AI safety.
# How does China approach AI regulation?
China was among the first nations to introduce AI-specific regulations, beginning in 2022, and has wide-ranging rules on harmful content, privacy and data security, for example. Developers of public-facing AI-powered services must let Chinese regulators test their systems ahead of deployment, says Ng. The result is that models such as those developed by the Hangzhou-based company DeepSeek, which found world fame with its R1 model earlier this year, are among "the most regulated in the world", says Joanna Bryson, a computer scientist and researcher in AI ethics at the Hertie School in Berlin. Despite this, the authorities often take a soft approach to enforcing that regulation, says Angela Zhang, a law researcher and specialist in AI regulation at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.
By contrast, the United States has no
comprehensive legislation on AI at the federal level, and in January President Donald Trump revoked an executive order aimed at ensuring AI safety. He has positioned his administration as pro-industry, last month suggesting in a social-media post that it would add a clause to a federal bill to prevent states from regulating AI. The European Union approach has been to classify AI systems by risk level, with different
"Al is general-purpose, fast-evolving and largely driven by the private sector."
rules relating to transparency and oversight at each tier, and obligations that came into force in August, aimed at the most powerful AI systems. The UK government, meanwhile, has shelved plans to introduce comprehensive AI legislation until next year, at the earliest.
# What international legislation exists to govern AI?
Very little. The only legally binding international regulation comes from the Council of Europe, an international organization of European member states, separate from the European Union, which established its Framework Convention on AI in May 2024. The treaty commits any signatory country to implementing its broad obligations – such as ensuring that AI activities align with human rights – through their national laws. But there are no sanctions and no supranational enforcement body, says Lucia Velasco, an economist and researcher at the Oxford Martin School's AI Governance Initiative, who is based in New York.
Companies and nations have also signed
various non-binding agreements, such as the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, the OECD AI Principles and the Bletchley Declaration, an international agreement signed by 28 countries at the UK AI Safety Summit in 2023. Several expert groups have produced documents outlining the risks, one of the most prominent being the International AI Safety Report. The United Nations (UN) is running a 'dialogue' process and has created a scientific panel to guide countries' regulatory efforts.
# What has China proposed?
WAICO would be a way for countries to coordinate AI governance rules while "fully respecting the differences in national policies and practices" and championing the global south, Chinese officials have said. China has proposed that the body's headquarters be in Shanghai, but other details remain uncertain.
WAICO looks unlikely to govern AI directly in any enforceable way (and China has said it backs a UN approach to governing global AI) but it could be a route for countries to gradually coalesce around a framework.
Xi's call to create WAICO was at least the fourth such push from a Chinese official in four months, suggesting the idea is important to the government, says Ng. One reason is commercial, says Zhang. "The fact that China is able to set standards helps China's product diffusion all over the world," she says.
The move also gives China some diplomatic cachet. "China is trying to be like [an older] brother to the global south, arguing 'we also need to have our voice in the governance of AI and not be dictated to'," says Zhang.
# What would a global form of governance look like?
We don't know. AI-safety experts often cite nuclear-power regulation and the creation of the International Atomic Energy Agency as an analogy, says Ng. Standards set by the UN agency are non-binding but are complemented by legally binding treaties it helped to forge, such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety.
Particularly compelling, says Ng, is to borrow from nuclear energy the idea of third-party or mutual inspections of AI development, to ensure adherence to any commitments. Another idea that has been floated is to create a body analogous to CERN, Europe's particle physics laboratory, where the most advanced AI could be generated by everybody, for the benefit of all. A third model is something resembling the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization, which develops technical standards for aviation that countries then incorporate into national law.
In all these examples, the UN, or a UN agency, was instrumental in their creation. However, "AI does not map neatly onto past governance models," says Velasco. "AI is
504

general-purpose, fast-evolving and largely driven by the private sector." The UN could be the venue from which a future global AI governance arrangement emerges, but this would require a member state to initiate that at the UN General Assembly, says Velasco.
# What are the chances of globally regulated AI happening soon?
A perceived race between the United States and China to dominate world AI makes creating any international agreement that would put limits on the technology "very difficult", says Grace Gonzales, a policy adviser at ControlAI, a London-based non-profit organization that works to reduce the risks to humanity from AI.
Since the Bletchley Declaration, the focus on Al safety has weakened at follow-up events in Seoul and Paris, and there is a "general lack of
robust governmental channels at the moment" involving major Al nations, says Ng. Although the UN is the platform that brings the most countries together, "it comes with a set of challenges", such as a lack of funding and the slow pace of processes, says Brian Tse, founder of Concordia AI.
Still, common standards can come about without international, binding agreements. WAICO could serve "a critical function" if it promotes common understanding of AI risks and capabilities, or helps countries to agree not to cross certain lines in AI development, says Ng.
The 1994 Convention on Nuclear Safety helped to improve reactor safety, but this came about only after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Union, says Tse. "In AI, our job is to make sure that we get ahead of the curve," he says.
# WHAT WILL BE THE FIRST AI-DESIGNED DRUG?
Just a year after the first AI-designed antibody was made, scientists say clinical trials are on the horizon.
# By Ewen Callaway
B iologists achieved a landmark in protein design last year: using artificial intelligence to draw up entirely new antibody molecules'. Yet the proof-of-principle designs lacked the potency and other key features of commercial antibody drugs that rack up tens of billions in annual sales.
After a year of progress, scientists say they are on the cusp of turning AI-designed antibodies into potential therapies. In recent weeks, numerous teams have reported successfully using proprietary commercial AI tools and open-source models to make antibodies that have properties of antibody drugs.
"These latest efforts are remarkably powerful advances that enable a democratization of antibody engineering," says Chang Liu, a synthetic biologist at University of California, Irvine.
The latest wave of success with denovo antibody design "will have a big impact on how quickly and how many denovo therapeutics we will see in clinical trials", adds Timothy Jenkins, a protein engineer at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby.
Therapeutic antibodies are usually made by screening vast numbers of diverse antibodies to find ones that can recognize a certain target.
But sometimes, these screens turn up only antibodies that bind weakly to the target or recognize the wrong region on it.
# Precision nanobodies
"There isn't much precision," says Surge Biswas, chief executive of antibody-design company Nabla Bio in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Instead, scientists hope to specify
![image](/66f8fa231619e539f3d7aa74351068edf7d54f08aa1eb38ea882f840fe277230.jpg)


Antibodies (pink) binding to a flu virus.

an antibody's desired target – the active site of an enzyme implicated in disease, for instance – and have an AI model suggest designs. "The promise of AI-guided design is that you can be atomically precise," Biswas adds.
Antibodies - immune proteins that recognize foreign molecules, such as those made by pathogens, with exquisite specificity - have been a challenge for AI to design. AI models such as AlphaFold have struggled to predict the shape of flexible loop regions of antibodies, which they use to recognize their targets.
But new tools developed in the past year – including an updated version of AlphaFold – have proved better at modelling these flexible regions, says Gabriele Corso, a machine-learning scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Progress in antibody design has followed.
In October, Corso and his colleagues described the BoltzGen model in a preprint $^{2}$ , showing that it can adroitly design 'nanobodies' - small, simple antibodies resembling molecules made by sharks and camels - against proteins implicated in cancer, viral and bacterial infections and other diseases. In most cases, the researchers identified antibodies with strong target binding after expressing just 15 of the most-promising designs in cells and testing them in laboratory experiments. However, the molecules were not tested in disease models.
Other teams are making similar progress. For instance, a team at Stanford University in California and the Arc Institute in Palo Alto, California, has also released a model that can design nanobodies with high efficiencies<sup>3</sup>. And last month, the researchers behind the 2024 breakthrough – led by Nobel-prizewinning biophysicist David Baker at the University of Washington in Seattle – reported in Nature<sup>4</sup> marked improvements in their nanobody design efforts, using another open-source tool.
# Full-length antibodies
The boldest claims in AI antibody design come from companies working on the challenge. Last month, scientists at Nabla and Chai Discovery in San Francisco, California, said they had made 'drug-like' antibodies using AI tools.
Both teams said that, in addition to nanobodies, which are composed of a single chain of amino acids, they had generated full-length antibodies. Baker's team reported such designs in their report as well. Lab experiments showed that some of the designer molecules recognized diverse disease targets – including molecules called G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which have challenged conventional antibody design efforts – at potencies similar to those of commercial antibody drugs. They also boasted useful properties that can make or break drug candidates, such as the capacity to be produced at high levels and to recognize only their intended targets.
